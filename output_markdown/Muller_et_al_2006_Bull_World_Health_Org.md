of high transmission intensity than in
regions of medium transmission intensity. [8] A possible explanation for this
paradox is the assumption that if malaria
transmission intensity is high, the age at
which functional immunity is acquired
may merge with the period of passively
transferred immunity and physiological protection in the first few months
of life. [9] As insecticide-treated nets are
now widely promoted in sub-Saharan
Africa, millions of neonates are likely to
have a much reduced rate of exposure
to malaria during their first few months
of life. [10]


## **Introduction**

Insecticide-impregnated bednets and
curtains have consistently been shown to
be effective in reducing malaria morbidity and all-cause mortality in children in
various malaria endemic areas. [1] However,
in recent years, controversy has emerged
about the long-term consequences of
protecting young children with impregnated nets and curtains in areas where
transmission intensity (i.e., the frequency
with which a person is exposed to infective mosquito bites) is high. Because
treated bednets and curtains prevent
children from being bitten by mosquitos,



these interventions may affect acquisition of natural immunity to malaria.
Thus, in areas of high transmission intensity, it is not clear whether treated
bednets and curtains have a positive, a
negative, or a neutral effect on the overall reduction of malaria morbidity and
mortality. [2–6]

The pattern of malaria morbidity, in
particular the rate of severe anaemia and
cerebral malaria, depends very much on
transmission intensity. [7] Concerns about
increased mortality associated with bednets are based on some evidence that
all-cause mortality is lower in regions

**Olaf Müller et al.** **Bednets in Africa**



To assess the benefits of insecticidetreated nets in areas of high malaria
transmission intensity, we conducted a
randomized controlled trial to compare
all-cause mortality in children who had
protection with treated nets from birth,
with another group who had protection
from age 6 months. We present study
data after a mean follow-up period of 27
months.

## **Methods**

#### **Study area**

The trial took place in the 41 villages of
the rural research zone of the Centre de
Recherche en Santé de Nouna (CRSN)
in Nouna Health District, north-western
Burkina Faso. The Nouna area is a dry
orchard savannah, populated mainly by
subsistence farmers of various ethnic
groups. Childhood mortality is high, with
significant variation between villages. [11]
Malaria is holoendemic but highly seasonal in the study area; the rainy season
lasts from July until October and the
main transmission period is between July
and December. [12] The number of infective bites per person per year — i.e., the
annual Entomological Inoculation Rate
(EIR) — varies between 100 and 1000
in the different study villages. [13] Formal
health services are limited to four rural
health centres and the district hospital in
Nouna town. As a consequence, malaria
control relies mainly on home-based
treatment with chloroquine, the official
first-line treatment drug in Burkina
Faso. [14] Treated bednets and curtains were
not available in the study area until the
start of this trial, and about one quarter
of young children were usually protected
with untreated bednets in the study villages during rainy seasons. [13, 15]

#### **Participants**

From June 2000, mothers of all neonates
born in the 41 CRSN study villages were
approached about inclusion of their
child in the trial. Recruitment was done
by three fieldworkers who were regularly
informed about births by village informants during their twice-weekly visits
to study villages. Village informants are
volunteers selected by the community to
facilitate the communication with the

CRSN. Inclusion criteria were recruitment within 2 weeks of birth, and being a
permanent resident in the study villages.

#### **Study design**

The study was designed as a randomized controlled effectiveness trial. All



neonates from the 41 study villages
were individually randomized to receive
either protection with treated bednets
and curtains from birth until their fifth
birthday (group A) or protection from
age 6 months until their fifth birthday
(group B).

#### **Outcomes**

Primary outcomes of the study were
all-cause mortality in all study children
and falciparum malaria incidence in a
subsample of study children. Methods
for subsample selection are outlined later
in Procedures.

Secondary outcomes were clinical
and parasitological variables in a subsample of study children; specifically,
moderate-to-severe anaemia (erythrocyte
volume fraction (haematocrit) <24%),
palpable spleen, and other morbidity. We
also recorded the existence of speciesspecific positive blood-films, speciesspecific malaria parasite densities, haematocrit values, and body weight during
cross-sectional follow-up visits.

#### **Sample size**

When the trial began in 2000, data from
the demographic surveillance system
showed infant and childhood mortality
rates in the study area were 67.4 and 27.9
per 1000, respectively. [16] To be able to detect a 25% mortality difference between
the intervention and control group in a
given year with 80% power and at a significance level of 5%, we calculated that
we would need to include 1450 children
in each group. To allow for a 15% loss
to follow-up, 1700 children per group
would be needed. We assumed that
there would be a mean of two falciparum
malaria episodes per child per year; thus,
a sample size of 210 children per group
with a mean observation time of 3 years
would enable us to detect a difference
in falciparum malaria incidence of 11%
with 80% power and at a significance
level of 5%.

#### **Randomization**

Fieldworkers were provided with 20
closed opaque envelopes, containing
equal numbers of intervention allocations. Randomizing envelopes were prepared by the study physician. A simple
sign (+ for group A, – for group B) indicated the study allocation. Whenever the
number of envelopes was reduced to 10,
another 10 envelopes containing equal
group numbers were added.


#### **Procedures**

Children were protected with green
family-size treated bednets and curtains
(PermaNet, Vestergaard Frandsen, Denmark). The choice of colour and size of
the nets was based on the results from
preceding qualitative interviews in the
study villages (data not shown). Delivery
of the nets was within 2 weeks of recruitement in group A and within 4 weeks of
age 6 months in group B.

To measure levels of compliance
with the treated-net intervention, we interviewed mothers of study participants
and made direct night-time observations
during cross-sectional surveys in all study
children from 15 of the 41 study villages.
Compliance was close to 100% during
the rainy season and around 70% during the dry season, with no differences
between group A and B. Details will be
published elsewhere.

Standard WHO bioassays and deltamethrin concentration measurements
were done on random samples of study
nets at the beginning of the trial. [17]
Because first-generation PermaNets are
known to have insufficient long-term
effectiveness, all nets used during the
trial were reimpregnated by the mothers
under supervision of study staff with
0.4 g deltamethrine (K-O TAB, Aventis)
before the beginning of the rainy season
each year. Retreatment coverage was always above 95%, and the efficacy against
Anopheles mosquitoes of reimpregnated
bednets was shown to be good. [18]

Moreover, in early November 2002,
we did morning pyrethrum spray catches
in a random sample of 33 households
with study children aged younger
than 6 months’ from three villages and
noted differences in the mean number
of mosquitos in rooms with insecticide-treated nets (0.9 (95% confidence
interval (CI): 0.18–1.56)) compared with
rooms without such nets (4.2 (95% CI:
1.12–7.22)). Finally, the condition of all
participants’ bednets and curtains was
assessed by the field supervisors during
the annual reimpregnation exercises. By
mid 2003, 16% of study nets had a few
(<4) holes, 8% had multiple (>4) holes,
2% were torn, 1% were burnt, but only
0.1% were considered unusable; there
were no differences in the condition of
nets between group A and B.

Collection of all-cause mortality data
took place through continuous information on all deaths of study children by the
village informants.

**Bednets in Africa** **Olaf Müller et al.**



Morbidity was measured in subgroups of the first 70 children recruited
from six study villages ( _n_ = 420). These
children were seen every second day by
village-based field staff, who systematically took their axillary temperature with
an electronic thermometer (Digital Classic, Hartmann, Germany) and filled in a
structured questionnaire in accordance
with reports from parents about their
child’s symptoms and any treatment
received.


Fieldworkers were trained to take
finger-prick blood samples and to prepare thick and thin blood films in case of
fever (>37.5 °C) or a history of fever in
the past 48 hours; They were also trained
in provision of presumptive malaria treatment, as outlined in national guidelines.
Fieldworkers were visited twice-weekly
by the study nurse who checked their
work, collected completed forms and
blood slides, examined and treated sick
children, and regularly reported to the
study physician. Study children who were
too ill to be treated at home were referred
to governmental health services.

In addition to longitudinal morbidity surveillance, cross-sectional surveys
were undertaken twice a year in all
children in the morbidity surveillance
subgroup. Surveys took place during low
(January to June) and high (July to December) malaria transmission periods.
Demographic data (age, sex, ethnicity),
parasitological data (thin and thick
blood films) and clinical data (medical
history, symptoms, temperature, spleen
size by Hackett score, bodyweight, haematocrit) were systematically collected
during surveys.

Blood was taken by fingerprick,
and haematocrit was measured with a
portable microhaematocrit centrifuge
(Compur Microspin, Bayer Diagnostics, Germany). Blood films were kept
in closed slide boxes until they were
transported to the CRSN laboratory in
Nouna town. After Giemsa staining, all
films were examined by two experienced
laboratory technicians. Thick and thin
blood films were analysed for the species-specific parasite density per m l by
counting against 200 white blood cells
and multiplying by 50 (we took into
consideration the higher number of
white blood cells in early infancy). Slides
were declared negative if no parasites
were found on the thick film after 15
minutes of searching. All lab technicians
were unaware of group assignments. We
randomly selected 10% of blood films

for re-examination at the laboratory
at the Heidelberg School of Tropical
Medicine. Concordance was 100% for
all slides with a parasite density above
5000 per m l blood. In slides with lower
parasite densities, 7% of slides were falsenegatives and 11% were false-positives.

#### **Statistical analysis**

Field data forms were checked manually
by supervisors for completeness before
independent computer entry (Microsoft
ACCESS, version 97) at CRSN. All data
were checked for range and consistency.
Any differences were resolved by checking against original case records.

Analysis was by intention-to-treat.
Primary and secondary outcomes were
systematically compared for the total
observation period as well as within three
age groups (<6 months, 6–12 months,
>12 months). A falciparum malaria
episode was defined as fever (axillary
temperature >37.5 °C) accompanied
by >5.000 _P. falciparum_ parasites per
m l (in the presence or absence of _P._
_malariae_ or _P. ovale_ parasites), with no
other obvious cause for the fever. This
case definition is similar to that used in
a previous trial. [13] We also analysed data
using other common case definitions for
mild and heavy malaria infections (i.e.,
fever plus any parasite count and fever
plus a parasite count of 100.000/ m l or
more, respectively.

#### **Analysis of longitudinal data**

The morbidity analysis was based on the
subsample of 420 children from the six
villages as described previously. We used
Poisson regression analysis to model
the group effect on number of episodes



_WHO 05.162_


of malaria or other morbidity. We calculated relative risks, 95% confidence
intervals and _P_ -values. To avoid inclusion
of recrudescent malaria episodes, the
individual observation time was defined
as the time interval from first to last day
of observation minus 20 days for each
defined falciparum malaria episode.
The log observation time was used as an
offset term.

We compared all-cause mortality between the overall study groups as well as
between the age-defined study subgroups
using a Cox proportional hazards model.
Extra Poisson variation was accounted
for in confidence interval estimation.
Vital status was assessed for all children

until 31 December 2003.

#### **Analysis of data from cross-** **sectional surveys**

We compared clinical and parasitological
variables in both groups with subgroup
analysis by age group. We used c ² tests
and, in case of small numbers, Fisher’s exact test-to-test differences for categorical
variables. _t_ -tests were used to compare
arithmetic means.

We used SAS software (version 9.1)
for all analyses.

#### **Ethics approval**

This study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the Heidelberg University Medical School and the Ministry of
Health in Burkina Faso. Before recruiting participants, we explained the trial
in detail to all district authorities. Village
meetings were held to explain the purpose, methods, benefits and risks of the
study to the population. Oral informed
consent was sought from the parents

or caretakers of study children. Treated
bednets and curtains were paid for by
the project, and all sick study children
received appropriate counselling and
treatment in the village free of charge,
or they were referred to governmental
health services.

## **Results**


By the end of December 2002, 3387
neonates (1673 girls and 1714 boys)
were enrolled in the study. 1695 were
randomly assigned to protection from
birth in group A and 1692 were assigned
to protection from age 6 months in
group B (Fig. 1). There were 888, 684,
711, 552 and 552 enrolments during
the periods June–December 2000, January–June 2001, July–December 2001,
January–June 2002 and July–December
2002, respectively; none of the parents
or caretakers refused consent for their
children to participate. Mean age at
enrolment was 8.5 days. 1684 (99.4%)
children in group A received their treated
bednets within 2 weeks of birth; likewise,
1678 (99.2%) participants in group B
received their bednets within 4 weeks of
age 6 months. In accordance with the
intention-to-treat analysis, we did not
exclude any children from the study after
randomization.



a Deaths per thousand person-years.

#### **Mortality**

By 31 December 2003, mean follow-up
in the study population was 26.6 months
(range 0.1–42.3), corresponding to 7506
person years (PY), with no differences
between group A (3773 PY) and group
B (3733 PY). At 31 December 2003,
257 (7.6%) children had died (137 boys
and 120 girls). There were 102 deaths in
the 0–5 months age group, 52 in 6–12
month-olds, and 103 in participants
aged more than 12 months with no differences between study groups (RR 1.0
(95% CI: 0.78–1.27) Fig. 1, Table 1).

#### **Morbidity** **Longitudinal data**

By 31 December 2003, the 420 study
children from the six morbidity observa


Table 1. **Number of deaths and mortality by age and study group**





tion villages had been followed up for a
mean of 31.8 months (range 0.1–42.3),
with no differences between study groups
(32.0 months in group A and 31.6
months in group B). Specific information on study outcomes was available
from 68% of observation days.

Overall, there were significantly
fewer episodes of falciparum malaria in
group A than in group B (881 vs 941; RR
1.11 (95% CI: 1.01–1.22); _P_ = 0.02).
This difference was attributed to significantly fewer episodes of falciparum malaria in group A than in group B during
the period from age 0–5 months (26 vs
77; RR 3.11 (1.99–4.85); _P_ <0.0001) and
from month 6–12 (152 vs 187; RR 1.33
(95% CI: 1.07–1.64); _P_ = 0.01). We did
not note any differences between groups
in children older than 12 months (703
vs 677; RR 0.99 (95% CI: 0.89–1.10);
_P_ = 0.85). We obtained similar betweengroup differences when using the definition for mild malaria, but we noted no
differences when using the definition for
heavy infections (Table 2).

There were no differences between
groups A and B in the carer-reported
prevalence of fever, lack of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea and cough. However, in
young infants (0–5 months), fever was
much less prevalent in group A than in
group B (689 vs 820 fever days, RR 1.23
(95% CI: 1.11–1.35); _P_ <0.0001).

#### **Cross-sectional survey data**

We undertook six cross-sectional surveys
on the 420 study children from the six
morbidity observation villages (in March
2001, November 2001, March 2002,
October 2002, March 2003 and November 2003).

In all, 290 children (152 in group A,
138 in group B) aged 0–5 months, 273
children (137 in group A, 136 in group
B) aged 6–12 months, and 406 children
(205 in group A, 201 in group B) older
than 12 months were examined.

There were no between-group differences in bodyweight, fever or malaria
prevalence. Hackett scores, prevalence
of _P. falciparum_ and anaemia, and mean
_P. falciparum_ parasite densities were
significantly lower, while haematocrit
values were significantly higher in group
A than in group B in children aged 6–12
months. However, there were no differences between groups in the 0–5 month
age group or in children older than 12
months, with the exception of lower
_P. falciparum_ prevalence rates in group
A than in group B in older children
(Table 3).

## **Discussion**

We found no evidence for a difference in
all-cause mortality during follow-up of
young children being protected (group
A) compared to those not being protected (group B) with insecticide-treated
nets during early infancy (0–5 months)
in an area of intense malaria transmission

in Burkina Faso.

Our data do not support findings
from an ecological study on the frequency
of severe childhood malaria as a proxy
indicator for malaria mortality in subSaharan hospitals that had suggested that
insecticide-treated nets were dangerous
when used to protect young infants living in hyperendemic or holoendemic
malaria areas. [7]

Instead, our data support results
from extended follow-ups of three large
cluster-randomized trials of treated nets

in sub-Saharan areas of intense malaria
transmission. [19–21] These trials were not,
however, specifically designed to address
the issue of possible delayed or rebound
mortality.

Moreover, that infant mortality in
the study cohort was 30% lower than
that recorded by the demographic surveillance system, and that _P. falciparum_
prevalence was 25% lower in our study
group than in previous studies of the
same population before the intervention (data not shown) provides some
evidence about the overall efficacy of
treated nets in real-life conditions. [1]
However, our mortality data can not
be fully compared with data from the
Nouna demographic surveillance system
because different methods were used for
data collection. [16]

The second main finding from this
study is an overall significantly lower
falciparum malaria morbidity in group
A than in group B, which supports the

efficacy of treated bednets in the prevention of malaria, particularly in young
children in sub-Saharan Africa. [1] Rates
of falciparum malaria and anaemia were
lower in group A than in group B during the first year of life, but there were
no differences in older children after
a follow-up period of up to 3.5 years.
Differences in malaria prevalence were
significant in the 0–5 months and 6–12
months age groups, while other malaria
variables showed significant differences
only in the 6–12 months age group.
Differences in malaria prevalence during
early infancy are clearly explained by the
fact that children in group B were not
protected by treated nets during their
first 6 months of life. The differences in
malaria morbidity noted during late infancy (6–12 months) might be explained
by a better development of the immune
system under conditions of low-tomoderate transmission intensity. Similar
findings are reported from studies on the
effects of intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in infants. [22] However,
our findings differ from observations
of rebound morbidity associated with



malaria chemotherapy in young children
in sub-Saharan Africa. [23] This difference
could be explained by the fact that the
treated nets lower, but do not completely
avoid, malaria transmission unlike the
more complete protection associated with
chemoprophylaxis. The exposure to malaria parasites of children protected with
treated nets in hyperendemic or holoendemic areas seems to be sufficient for the
development of protective immunity.

To our knowledge this is the first
major trial of insecticide-treated nets that
uses individual randomization rather
than a cluster-randomized trial design.
Because of the design of our trial and
the coexistence of group A and group B
children in all study villages, differences
in malaria exposure during the first 6
months of life have to be attributed to
the protective effects of the bednet itself,
together with the repellent effect of the
insecticide, and not to a possible mass
effect of bednet use. [24–26] However, that
such a mass effect was not seen in all areas
of sub-Saharan Africa where major trials
of treated nets have been implemented
must be considered. [27] In our study, a

major mass effect is not likely to have
occurred given the incomplete coverage
with insecticide-treated nets, our finding of fewer mosquitoes in rooms with
treated nets compared with those without nets, and the demonstrated effects of
the intervention on malaria morbidity.

This study was a large randomized
controlled trial in a representative population of young African children, with
sufficient power to detect mortality and
morbidity differences associated with the
intervention. The insecticide-treated nets
were shown to be effective against the
local vector, compliance with the intervention was shown to be good, case detection has been intense and individual
randomization made systematic errors
unlikely. Although the confidence inter

val for the mortality comparison between
groups shows a difference that, in theory,
is of public health importance, there was
no trend towards increasing mortality
in older study children. Follow-up for
all-cause mortality is planned through
the existing demographic surveillance
system until all study children have
reached their 5th birthday. However, the
largest effects of the intervention would
have been expected in early childhood;
this assumption is supported by malaria
parasite prevalence rates having remained
above 50%, despite good compliance
with the net intervention in the young
children of this study cohort.

Our findings provide additional
evidence for the efficacy of insecticidetreated bednets and curtains in areas



of intense malaria transmission. There
should be no further delay of large-scale
implementation of insecticide-treated
bednets in sub-Saharan Africa. O
