**Abstract**

**Background:** To increase the effectiveness of insecticide-treated nets (ITN) in areas of high resistance, new longlasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) called new-generation nets have been developed. These nets are treated with the
piperonyl butoxide (PBO) synergist which inhibit the action of detoxification enzymes. The effectiveness of the
new-generation nets has been proven in some studies, but their specific effect on mosquitoes carrying detoxification enzymes and those carrying both detoxification enzymes and the knock-down resistance gene in Benin is not
well known. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of LLINs treated with PBO on multi-resistant
Anopheles gambiae s.l.

**Methods:** The study occurred in seven cities in Benin, Abomey, Cotonou, Porto-Novo, Zangnanado, Parakou, Malanville and Tanguiéta, and included ten locations selected on a north–south transect. Mosquito larvae were collected
from these sites, and adult females from these larvae were exposed to single-pyrethroid-treated nets (LifeNet, PermaNet 2.0, Olyset Net) and bi-treated nets (PermaNet 3.0 and Olyset Plus) based on their level of resistance and using
WHO cone tests following WHO guidelines.

**Results:** The different LLINs showed 100% mortality of the susceptible laboratory strain Kisumu and the resistant strain Ace-1R Kisumu. However, with the resistant laboratory strain kdr-Kisumu, mortality was low (16–32%) for
all LLINs except PermaNet 3.0 (82.9%). The mortality of local strains carrying only the kdr mechanism varied from 0
to 47% for the single-pyrethroid-treated LLINs and 9 to 86% for bi-treated LLINs. With local strains carrying several
mechanisms of resistance (kdr + detoxification enzymes), the observed mortality with different LLINs was also low
except for PermaNet 3.0, which induced significantly higher mortality, usually greater than 75% (p < 0.001), with multiresistant strains. The inhibition of the mortalities induced by the LLINs (11–96%) on multi-resistant field populations
was similar to the inhibition observed with the laboratory strain carrying only the knock-down resistance mechanism
(kdr-Kisumu) (p > 0.05).

**Conclusion:** This study showed that the new-generation LLINs treated with pyrethroids and PBO showed better
efficacy compared to conventional LLINs. Although the addition of PBO significantly increased the mortality of mosquitoes, the significant role of the kdr resistance gene in the low efficacy of LLINs calls for LLIN technology innovation
that specifically targets this mechanism.

**Background**
Malaria is a major public health problem worldwide,
and particularly so in Benin. It remains a permanent
threat from its high morbidity (214 million) and mortality (438,000). Africa is the most endemic region
affected (395,000 deaths per year) [1]. It affects onefifth of the world population. However, this proportion
has decreased significantly by 37% between 2000 and
2015 due to the effect of malaria prevention and treatment methods, including long-lasting insecticidal nets
(LLINs), indoor residual spraying of residual insecticides
(IRS), chemo-prevention for pregnant women and children, and therapeutic treatment with artemisinin-based
combinations.

Among these prevention methods, LLINs have
emerged in recent years as a privileged tool to prevent
malaria. Te insecticides selected by the World Health
Organization (WHO) for LLIN treatment are pyrethroids, which have little toxicity to humans, are effective at low doses, are fast acting (knock-down effect)
and, along with repellants, have an irritant effect [2]. Te
Abuja Conference, which brought together all the leaders
of Africa and other UN representative states, donors and
NGOs in April 2000, gave impetus to a political commitment to the fight against malaria with the use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) [3]. Efforts are being made to
increase accessibility for populations, especially pregnant
women and children under five, who are vulnerable to
malaria, a major cause of perinatal mortality, low birth
weight and maternal anaemia [1].
Several research studies have been conducted and
have shown the effectiveness of ITNs in the fight against
malaria in Burkina Faso [4], Cameroon [5], Gambia [6–
9], the Democratic Republic of Congo [10], Kenya [11],
Ghana [12], Benin [13] and Côte d’Ivoire [14].
However, several studies have shown that Anopheles
gambiae s.l. has developed strong resistance to pyrethroids and DDT in Benin, with a very high knock-down
resistance frequency of approximately 80% in the urban
areas of Cotonou and in rural areas [15–23].
Despite this resistance developed by An. gambiae s.l. to
pyrethroids, LLINs remain effective in vector resistance
areas [24] and provide protection through their mechanical barrier role [25]. However, Asidi et al. [26] showed a
decrease in their effectiveness in areas of high resistance
of Anopheles in southern Benin. Major developed resistance mechanisms are the targets of modification (kdr
resistance and ace-1R) and metabolic resistance (overexpression of detoxification enzymes, oxidases, esterases,
GST) [27]. Te kdr mutation is associated with pyrethroid and DDT resistance, and ace-1R is associated with
organophosphate and carbamate resistance (two classes
of insecticides which are not used to treat LLINs) [15, 28].



To increase the effectiveness of ITNs in areas of high
resistance, new nets treated with a so-called new-generation of chemicals has been developed. Tey are treated
with a synergist called piperonyl butoxide (PBO). For
some LLINs, the PBO is used on all sides of the net
(Olyset Plus [®] ). For others, only the upper part of the
net is processed (PermaNet [®] 3.0). Te principle of an
ITN synergist is to inhibit the action of detoxification
enzymes, which will result in increasing the effectiveness of the insecticide against resistant populations of
mosquitoes.
Evidence of the efficacy of PermaNet 3.0 has been
shown in some studies, particularly in Tanzania [29],
but we do not know its specific action on mosquitoes
carrying detoxification enzymes and on those carrying
both detoxification and kdr mechanisms in West Africa,
particularly in Benin. Tere have been limited data on
the bio-efficacy of new-generation LLINs against multiresistant mosquitoes in Africa in general and particularly
in Benin. Tus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs)
treated with PBO on multi-resistant An. gambiae s.l.
populations in Benin. It aims to assess the bio-efficacy
of LLINs in areas with a high frequency of molecular
resistance genes (kdr and ace-1R) and over-expression of
detoxification enzymes (oxidases, esterases, GST). Te
efficacy of the new-generation LLINs against pyrethroidresistant Anopheles was also compared to that of conventional LLINs.


**Methods**

**Study design**
Tis study is transversal and compares variability of the
efficacy of two different types of LLINs against An. gambiae s.l. carrying kdr resistance mutations and detoxification enzymes in Benin. Te two types of LLINs included
conventional LLINs only treated with pyrethroids (Olyset
Net, LifeNet, and PermaNet 2.0) and a second type of
new-generation LLIN treated with pyrethroids and
piperonyl butoxide (PBO), which inhibits the action of
enzymes, particularly oxidases.
Te study was conducted in Benin, a West African
country from June 2015 to March 2016. Among the 12
departments of Benin surveyed, seven were selected in
this study (Atlantique, Littoral, Oueme, Zou, Borgou,
Atacora and Alibori). Priority was given to areas where
higher oxidase activity was observed compared to the
susceptible strain An. gambiae Kisumu. Tey were represented by Abomey, Cotonou, Porto-Novo, Zangnanado, Parakou, Malanville and Tanguiéta districts. Te
assessment of oxidase activity was conducted on 50 An.
gambiae s.l. collected from each district using haem-peroxidase assay as described by Brogdon et al. [30].

Te larvae of these mosquito populations were collected
in different ecological areas (vegetable, urban, rice and
cotton areas). Te study was also conducted on resistant
laboratory strains (kdr-Kisumu and ace-1R-Kisumu).

**Larvae collection**

Bio-efficacy tests were conducted at various selected
sites. Such tests required mosquitoes of 2–5 days old,
so the larvae were collected. Tese collections were
conducted in the different localities mentioned above.
Anopheles gambiae s.l. larvae and pupae were collected
from different locations at each site and carried to the
insectarium of the Entomological Research Center of
Cotonou (CREC), where they were reared to adult stage
at a relative humidity of 70–80% and a temperature of
25–30 °C. Female adults aged 2–5 days were used for bioefficacy tests.


**Highlighting resistance mechanisms**
Before the bioassays, living and dead mosquito populations kept after susceptibility testing were analyzed by
PCR to detect the genotypes of the kdr gene. Te detection of kdr mutation L1014F was performed according to
the method of Martinez-Torres et al. [31].
For the molecular characterization of insecticide resist
ance, two molecular markers were used for characterization of the resistance genes, kdr and ace-1R.
Similarly, for the biochemical characterization of resistance mechanisms, biochemical assays were performed
to compare the activity levels of mixed function oxidases
(MFO), non-specific esterases (NSE) and glutathione
S-transferases (GST) according to the protocol described
by Hemingway et al. [32] in susceptible Kisumu and field
An. gambiae strains. Te mosquitoes used for biochemical analysis had not been exposed to insecticides before
the biochemical assessment. Tese enzyme activities
were measured using a sample of 50 mosquitoes per site.


**Mosquito nets**
Five types of long-lasting insecticidal nets were evaluated in this study. Te group of mono-treated LLINs
included LifeNet (polypropylene LLIN with fiber coated
with 340 mg/m [2] ± 25% deltamethrin), Olyset Net (polyethylene LLIN with permethrin incorporated into the
fibers at 20 ± 3 g/kg), and PermaNet 2.0 (polyester LLIN
with fiber coated with deltamethrin at 55 mg/m [2] ± 25%).
Te group of new-generation LLINs included: Olyset
Plus (same characteristics as Olyset Net but with PBO
incorporated throughout the LLIN) and PermaNet 3.0
(polyethylene roof with deltamethrin at 2.8 g/kg ± 25%
and PBO at 4.0 g/kg ± 25% incorporated into the fibers, and polyester lateral sides with the fibers coated
with deltamethrin at 2.8 g/kg ± 25%). All these nets were
obtained from local markets. All nets included in the

study are rectangular and were selected by type.

**Cone test**

Te cone test is used to assess the effectiveness of an
insecticide and its persistence on the net. It was conducted following the WHO protocol. Tis test aims to
compare the behaviour of mosquitoes while in contact
with treated mosquito nets without PBO or with PBO.
Cone tests were performed on five types of nets (Olyset
Plus, Olyset Net, LifeNet, PermaNet 2.0 and PermaNet
3.0). Tese tests were carried out using fragments of
LLINs (30 cm × 30 cm) cut from five (05) positions on
each net. Two standard cones were fixed with a plastic
sheet on each of the five (05) screen fragments. For PermaNet 3.0 LLIN, an additional two cones were added on
the PBO-containing roof. Five unfed An. gambiae females
aged 2–5 days (Kisumu or wild type) were introduced
into each cone placed on the LLIN for 3 min. After exposure, the mosquitoes were removed from the cones using
a mouth aspirator and then transferred into paper cups
and provided 10% sugar solution. Mosquito knock-down
was recorded every 5 min for 60 min. A negative control
(untreated net) was included in each series of cone tests.
After 24 h of observation, mortality post exposure was
recorded. No correction of mortality with Abbott’s formula was used as mortality in the control was <5%. All
these operations were carried out at a temperature of
25 ± 2 °C and a humidity of 70 ± 10%.


**Data analysis**
According to the WHO, the bio-effectiveness threshold is
95% knock-down and 80% mortality for laboratory mosquitoes; but for resistant field mosquito populations, we
used a threshold of 70% knock-down and 50% mortality. Terefore, all nets showing less than 95% knockdown
for laboratory mosquitoes and 70% for field mosquitoes
after 60 min, or less than 50% mortality for laboratory
mosquitoes and 50% for field mosquitoes after 24 h of
observation, were considered ineffective. Tese knockdown thresholds were chosen taking into account the
kdr resistance level observed in the country in general
(>50%).
Te inhibition of mortality induced by resistance
mechanisms was estimated using the following equation:


Inhibition = 1 − (p1 / p2) × 100


=
where p1 proportion of resistant mosquitoes dead and
p2 = proportion of susceptible Kisumu mosquitoes dead.
To determine if there was any significance difference
between the outcome variables (knock-down, mortality
and inhibition), Poisson regression (for numeric data)
and logistic regression (for proportional data) were used.
Te 50 and 95% knock-down times and their confidence
intervals were obtained after log-probit regression using
the method described by Finney [33].



**Results**

**Characteristics of the studied mosquito populations**
Te majority of female mosquitoes were collected and
identified morphologically as An. gambiae s.l. Te biochemical and molecular analyses indicated that among
ten sites, five showed significantly higher oxidase activity than the susceptible strain Kisumu (Table 1). Esterases
were significantly expressed in the Tanguieta mosquito
population (Table 1). Over-expression of glutathioneS-transferase was observed at four sites (Table 1). However, the allelic frequency of the kdr mutation was high at
almost all sites and ranged from 0.03 to 0.93.


**Knock-down (KD) and mortality of laboratory strains**
Figure 2 shows the proportion of laboratory mosquitoes
(ace-1R-Kisumu, kdr-Kisumu, and susceptible Kisumu)
knocked down after 60 min for each LLIN. Te Olyset
Plus and PermaNet 3.0 LLINs induced 100% knock-down
of An. gambiae Kisumu. Te knock-down effect was
96.15% for Olyset, 90.2% for LifeNet and 93.22% for PermaNet 2.0.

With the ace-1R-Kisumu strain, which carries the acetylcholinesterase-1 resistance gene, there was a knockdown effect greater than 95% for all nets, with 98.11% for
LifeNet, 100% for Olyset, 98.18% for Olyset Plus, 97.96%
for PermaNet 2.0, and 98.78% for PermaNet 3.0 (Fig. 2).
For the kdr-Kisumu strain (carrying the resistance
knock-down), the knock-down effects observed were
89.29% for LifeNet, 63.64 for Olyset Net, 71.43% for
Olyset Plus, 45.78 for PermaNet 2.0 and 71.05% for PermaNet 3.0 (Fig. 2).
Kisumu and ace-1R-Kisumu (Fig. 3). With the kdrKisumu strain, mortality was 16% for Olyset Net, 26% for
PermaNet 2.0, 28% for LifeNet, and 32.1% for Olyset Plus
but was more than 82.9% for PermaNet 3.0. Terefore,
based on the bio-efficacy threshold set by WHO (80%),
PermaNet 3.0 was effective on all laboratory strains, and
Olyset Plus was only effective on the susceptible and aceR1-Kisumu strains (Fig. 3).


**Inhibition of mortality conferred by the kdr resistance gene**
Comparing the mortality observed with the susceptible Kisumu strain with that of the resistant kdr-Kisumu

strain, the inhibition of mortality induced by the kdr gene
regarding the effectiveness of LLINs was 84% for Olyset
Net, 74% for PermaNet 2.0, 72% for LifeNet, 68% for
Olyset Plus and 17% for PermaNet 3.0.


**Knock-down (Kd) effect and mortality induced**
**by mosquito nets on local An. gambiae s.l.**
Approximately 2819 local An. gambiae s.l. mosquitoes
and 889 An. gambiae Kisumu laboratory strain mosquitoes were tested on different types of LLINs. Tables 2 and

**Knock-down (KD) and mortality induced by the LLINs**
**on mono-resistance mosquito strains**
Only PermaNet 3.0, Olyset Plus and LifeNet LLINs
showed a knock-down effect greater than 50% at Agblangandan, Vossa, Zangnanado and Malanville (areas of low
resistance) (Table 2). Tese knock-down values varied
between 51 and 95%. At Abomey, only PermaNet 3.0 and
Olyset Plus LLINs showed a knock-down effect greater
than 50%.
PermaNet 3.0 was the only LLIN that showed significantly higher mortality of greater than 50% in all localities
where mosquitoes carried only the kdr gene. Te average
mortality for other types of LLINs tested in these areas
varied from 5 to 47% (Table 2). Tese mortality rates varied from 0 to 14% for Olyset, 7 to 27% for LifeNet, from 9
to 22% for Olyset Plus, from 24 to 47% for PermaNet 2.0
and from 40 to 86% for PermaNet 3.0.


**Inhibition of mortality in mono-resistant An. gambiae s.l.**

**strains**

Te observed inhibition of mortality induced by kdr
resistance of local mosquito strains on LLIN effectiveness
was 100–86% for Olyset, 92–73% for LifeNet, 53–76% for
PermaNet 2.0, 78–91% for Olyset Plus and 14–60% for
PermaNet 3.0. Tese inhibition rates are similar to those

observed with the kdr-Kisumu strain (p > 0.05).

**Knock-down (KD) and mortality induced by the LLINs**
**on multi-resistant mosquito strains (carrying kdr**
**and biochemical resistance mutations)**
In areas with multi-resistance, the knock-down effects
observed were also low (Table 3).
At Akron, the percentage of mosquitoes knocked
down after 60 min was 31.48% [19.52–45.55] and
74.55% [60.99–85.33] for Olyset Net and Olyset Plus,

respectively; 70.49% [57.43–81.84] and 81.71% [71.63–
89.38] for PermaNet 2.0 and PermaNet 3.0, respectively,
and 30.77% [18.71–45.1] for LifeNet. At Houéyiho, the
knock-down effect was 23.08% [12.53–36.84] and 49.15%

[35.89–62.5] for Olyset Net and Olyset Plus, respectively;
46.3% [32.62–60.39] and 73.5% [61.46–83.97] for PermaNet 2.0 and PermaNet 3.0, respectively, and 61.11%

[46.87–74.08] for LifeNet. It was generally observed that
knock-down was significantly higher with Olyset Plus
than with Olyset on multi-resistant Akron and Houéyiho strains (p < 0.05). Te same observation was made
with PermaNet 3.0, whose knock-down was significantly
higher than that observed with PermaNet 2.0.
Te same observations were made at Ladji, Parakou
and Tanguiéta, where the KD induced by Olyset Plus was
higher than that of Olyset. Similarly, PermaNet 3.0 (98%)
was more effective than PermaNet 2.0 (39%) (Table 3).
However, at Tanguieta, only three LLINs were tested.
Te three types of mosquitoes tested showed a KD effect
≥75%. Overall, in areas where there was high activity of
oxidase enzymes associated with the kdr gene, only three
LLINs (LifeNet, Olyset Plus, and PermaNet 3.0) showed
a KD effect that was generally high. However, the mortality observed in these populations was generally low
(Table 3). Only the PermaNet 3.0 LLIN induced significantly higher mortality (p < 0.001) that was generally
greater than 75% (Table 3).



**Inhibition of mortality in multi-resistant strains**
Te inhibition of the mortality induced by LLINs
observed with strains carrying several resistance mechanisms (compared to the susceptible strain Kisumu)
ranged from 60 to 96% for Olyset, 53 to 90.2% for
LifeNet, 45 to 86% for PermaNet 2.0, 59 to 76% for Olyset
Plus and 11 to 55% for Permanet 3.0. Tese inhibition

rates are similar to those observed with the kdr-Kisumu

strains (p > 0.05).


**Knock-down time of LLINs on local An. gambiae s.l. strains**
Te average time estimated for knock-down of 50% of
resistant local An. gambiae s.l. populations was significantly shorter with PermaNet 3.0 (12 min) (p < 0.001),
followed by Olyset Plus and LifeNet (33 min). However, the time required for 95% of mosquitoes to be
knocked down was high for all LLINs. Generally, there
was a slower effect with LLINs treated with permethrin
(Table 4).


**Discussion**

Tis study is one of the first conducted in Benin to compare the response of local malaria vectors in Benin to
several LLINs recommended by the WHO. It helps to
observe the variation in mortality of vectors submitted
to different types of LLINs. Tis mortality was generally
low, especially with LLINs only treated with pyrethroids.

Cone tests showed that LLINs treated with piperonyl
butoxide and pyrethroids (especially PermaNet 3.0) have
optimum efficacy on all strains of An. gambiae s.l. (mono
and multi-resistant).
Several studies have shown a decrease in the bio-efficacy of LLINs against local pyrethroid-resistant vectors

[34, 35]. Te effectiveness of LLINs treated only with deltamethrin (PermaNet 2.0 and LifeNet) was found to be
significantly lower compared to that of nets treated with
deltamethrin and PBO. Te same observation was made
with the LLINs treated with permethrin only (Olyset Net)
and those treated with permethrin and PBO. However,
the effectiveness of LLINs treated with permethrin was
generally lower than that of LLINs treated with deltamethrin, with lower mortality and a very slow knock-down

time (KDT 50 and 95%) compared to other LLINs. In a
recent study conducted in Benin [36], Olyset Plus, treated
with permethrin + PBO, demonstrated a higher efficacy
than Olyset Net against wild multi-resistant An. gambiae
s.l. in experimental huts, as observed in WHO cone tests
used in the present study. In south-western Ethiopia [35]
and in Uganda [34], a reduced efficacy of mono-treated
LLINs was also observed against wild resistant An. gambiae s.l. in comparison with Permanet 3.0 treated with
deltamethrin + PBO. Te results are similar to those
observed in this study. However, these studies did not
include Olyset Plus, the second type of new-generation
LLINs treated with permethrin + PBO.
Te reduced efficacy of LLINs treated with permethrin
would be related to the strong resistance of the local vectors to permethrin due to the resistance selection pressures generated by the use of the same class of insecticide
for malaria vector control in public health and for pest
control in agriculture [16, 17, 23, 37, 38].
Te comparison of LLIN bio-efficacy performed in this
study provides the necessary information for the selection of appropriate LLINs for mass distribution. Te optimal and constant efficacy of PermaNet 3.0 LLINs on all
vector populations shows that this combination of deltamethrin and PBO on LLINs is a most successful strat
egy against pyrethroid resistance in Benin. Variations in
the mortality of vectors also showed that certain types
of LLINs are more appropriate than others for distribution in specific regions. Tis is related to the fact that
the effectiveness of an LLIN depends on the characteristics of the mosquito population tested and the chemical
structure of the molecule (insecticide) used.
Te mosquito populations assessed in the present study
were characterized by a high frequency of the kdr gene.
Tis high frequency was probably due to the massive use
of pyrethroids in agriculture and public health. In some
areas, such as Tanguieta, Parakou, Houeyiho, Akron,
and Ladji, farmers and gardeners use huge amounts of
insecticides to reduce pests in their crops, which explains
the presence and strong expression of several resistance
mechanisms in the mosquito populations [39, 40]. Overproduction of resistance enzymes in these areas would be
linked to pressure on mosquito larvae from insecticides
used by farmers to protect vegetable crops [41–43]. Tis
expression of the kdr resistance gene induced a 17–84%
reduction in LLIN efficacy against laboratory strains.
Tese frequencies are similar to those observed in natural populations of An. gambiae s.l. Tis observation
shows that the kdr gene is the main mechanism involved
in the reduction of the effectiveness of LLINs. Although
detoxification enzymes contribute to resistance, their
impact is successfully inhibited by the presence of PBO
on new-generation LLINs and the remaining part is more



likely related to the presence of kdr gene in the mosquito
populations. Tis also suggests that the search for new
molecules or combinations of molecules that target the
kdr resistance mechanism should be promoted.
Te WHO recommends preventive measures against
vector resistance to insecticides [44]. Te results of this
study therefore constitute important evidence that can
guide decision making in the selection and distribution of
high efficacy LLINs in specific regions of Benin. Te use
of LLINs that showed high bio-efficacy against the local
vector populations should be encouraged to contribute
substantively to reducing the transmission of malaria in
Benin.

Tis study also suggests the need to develop a routine
for monitoring the bio-efficacy of LLINs against local
malaria vectors for the replacement of ineffective LLINs.
However, community studies would be needed to evaluate the epidemiological impact of these LLINs to confirm
whether or not the low efficacy observed is followed by a
loss of the epidemiological impact of these nets.
Although the important results of this study, it had
certain limitations. Strong evaluation would have been
possible if tunnel tests were conducted on LLINs that
did not meet the criteria of 80% mortality with resistant mosquito strains. In addition, a chemical analysis of
the LLINs prior to the start of the study would also have
improved the quality of the results. However, all the
LLINs demonstrated a good performance with susceptible laboratory stain Kisumu (mortality > 80%), as recommended by WHO [45], and the focus of this study was
to demonstrate the important role of resistance mechanisms on LLINs efficacy.


**Conclusion**

Tis study showed variable effectiveness of LLINs on An.
gambiae s.l. populations from different localities surveyed
from north to south in Benin. Te new-generation LLINs
with pyrethroids and PBO (PermaNet 3.0 and Olyset Plus)
showed higher efficacy than conventional LLINs (PermaNet 2.0, LifeNet and Olyset net). However, the strong
resistance of local vectors to permethrin suggests that the
combination of deltamethrin + PBO is the most appropriate strategy against local vectors in Benin. Although the
addition of PBO (targeting many biochemical mechanisms
of resistance) significantly increased the mortality of mosquitoes, the significantly high role of the kdr resistance
gene in the low efficacy of LLINs calls for LLIN technology
innovation that specifically targets this mechanism.
