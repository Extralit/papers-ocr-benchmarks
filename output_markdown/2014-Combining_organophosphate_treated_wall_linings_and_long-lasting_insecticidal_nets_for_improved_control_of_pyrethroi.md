Introduction


Malaria vector control largely depends on a limited collection of
tools. Long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual
spraying (IRS) have contributed significantly to the recent
reductions in malaria morbidity and mortality burdens [1], and
these interventions are reliable and effective in a wide range of
situations. LLINs are easy to deliver even in the most remote
communities and hence have been more widely deployed in
malaria endemic countries in sub-Saharan Africa. IRS requires
more complex operational delivery systems; it is thus mostly used
in a targeted approach. Alternative efficacious and practical tools
for delivering insecticides indoors need to be urgently developed in
order to diversify the ‘‘tool-box’’ for malaria vector control and to



enhance capacity to effectively interrupt malaria transmission in
holo-endemic areas in sub-Saharan Africa.

The covering of home walls with insecticidal materials is a novel
approach that simulates IRS. Insecticide treated plastic wall linings
also known as durable lining (DL) can be produced via the longlasting net technology which incorporates the insecticide into the
fibres before yarn extrusion. Long-lasting pyrethroid DL when
used on interior walls, showed high acceptability and little or no
decline in bioefficacy after 12–15 months with minimal loss of
insecticide [2,3]. Due to the long-lasting technology, it is hoped
that pyrethroid DL may only need to be replaced on walls after 3–
4 years. It can therefore be regarded as a long-lasting alternative to
IRS which would be vital for high malaria transmission areas

where recurrent IRS treatments are normally required for
interruption of transmission. DL also has the advantage of
providing a more uniform covering of the wall with insecticide
compared to IRS and of improving the interior appearance of
traditional dwellings especially in rural areas [3]. However, in the
current era of pyrethroid resistance [4,5], the future of pyrethroid
DL is rather questionable. Studies on pyrethroid DL in West
Africa revealed relatively low mortality rates of 37–47% against
pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes in experimental hut trials [6,7].
Mortality rates .70% have been recorded with pyrethroid IRS in
a pyrethroid susceptible area in West Africa [8]. To reduce
selection pressure for pyrethroid resistance on malaria vectors, the
WHO recommends that pyrethroids should be reserved only for
treating LLINs since they remain the most appropriate class of
insecticides for this purpose [9]. This requires that DL treated with
alternative insecticides should be urgently investigated and
developed. One potential candidate insecticide is the WHOapproved organophosphate insecticide pirimiphos methyl (pmethyl). A new micro-encapsulated formulation of p-methyl
(Actellic CS) shows residual activity for up to 9 months as an
IRS treatment on cement walls and has been shown to control

pyrethroid resistant An gambiae [10].
In rural Africa, householders often cover their walls with wall
hangings made from netting material to improve interior aesthetic
appearance. Insecticide treated net wall hangings (NWH) could
function in a manner which is similar to DL and could be a more

acceptable, practical and innovative means for delivering insecticides indoors. Curtains treated with pyrethroids have been shown
to be effective against vectors of dengue in South America [11,12].
The potential of such materials to control malaria vectors is yet to
be fully explored.
It is now clear that the development and rapid spread of
insecticide resistance in An gambiae populations across Africa [4,13]
is well capable of undermining vector control [8,14–16]. The
World Health Organisation (WHO) calls for an immediate proactive response to insecticide resistance to sustain the effectiveness
of malaria vector control [9,17]. This requires investigating ways
in which insecticide resistance management can be applied for
vector control. One available strategy is to combine interventions
which deliver unrelated insecticides in the same place and at the
same time [17]. This approach has potential to improve the
control of the insect vector population and manage the spread of
insecticide resistant insect genotypes [18,19]. The latter is based on
the concept that insect genotypes which are resistant to the
insecticide in one intervention can be killed by the insecticide in
the other intervention [20].
The aim of the current study was to investigate via a series of
experimental hut trials whether DL or NWH treated with
pirimiphos methyl (p-methyl) CS applied alone or in combination
with LLINs has the potential to control malaria transmitted by
pyrethroid resistant Anopheles gambiae s.s. in Burkina Faso.
Comparison was made to currently available pyrethroid DL.
Using molecular genotyping studies, the capacity of the combination to potentially manage insecticide resistance by preventing the
selection of organophosphate and pyrethroid resistant genotypes
was also investigated.


Materials and Methods


Experimental huts
The trials were carried out at the Centre Muraz experimental
hut station in Valley du Kou 5 (4u259W, 11u249N) situated near
Bobo-Dioulasso, in South-western Burkina Faso. The station is
surrounded by a huge rice growing valley. The rainy season



Combining Vector Control Interventions


extends from June to October and the dry season from November
to May. The rice paddies provide extensive breeding sites for
mosquitoes throughout the year. The two molecular forms M and
S of An gambiae s.s. occur in sympatry notably at the end of the

obtained from Centre Muraz. The experimental huts are built on
concrete plinths surrounded by water-filled moats to prevent entry
of scavenging ants. Veranda traps capture the exiting mosquitoes.
The huts are made of brick plastered with cement on the inside,
with a corrugated iron roof. The ceiling is made of thick
polyethylene sheeting and the walls have four window slits (1 cm
gap) through which mosquitoes enter. Prior to the study, huts were
refurbished to reduce any possibility of contamination from
previous trials.


Susceptibility tests
During the trials, samples of adult An. gambiae which emerged
from larvae collected from the experimental hut site (Valley du
Kou 5) were tested in WHO test kits for susceptibility to
pyrethroids using deltamethrin 0.05% treated papers and to
organophosphates using p-methyl 0.25% treated papers. 0.25%
was used as a diagnostic dose for p-methyl based on preliminary
studies which showed a concentration of,0.1% induced 100%

mortality in the An gambiae kisumu laboratory susceptible strain
(Ranson et al, unpublished data).


Experimental hut treatments
Three experimental hut trials were carried out. The first two

Frandsen, Switzerland). The level of interior coverage required for
optimum impact (walls only versus walls and ceiling) was also
investigated. The following six single treatments were tested in the
first trial:


1. Untreated Control (untreated plastic sheeting)
2. Pyrethroid treated durable lining (ZeroVectorH, Vestergaard
Frandsen, Switzerland) on walls

3. P-methyl CS treated durable lining (p-methyl DL) on walls

4. P-methyl CS treated net wall hangings (p-methyl NWH) on
walls

5. P-methyl DL on walls and ceilings

6. P-methyl NWH on walls and ceilings

were tested:


1. Untreated Net with 6 holes

2. Pyrethroid LLIN (PermanetH 2.0 Vestergaard Frandsen,
Switzerland), with 6 holes

3. P-methyl DL on walls and ceilings

4. P-methyl NWH on walls and ceilings

5. P-methyl DL on walls and ceilings+Pyrethroid LLIN with 6
holes

6. P-methyl NWH on walls and ceilings+Pyrethroid LLIN with 6
holes



PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e83897


The aim of this trial was to explore the advantage of p-methyl DL
over currently available pyrethroid DL to see whether there was
any benefit to using the organonophosphate over the pyrethroid
on the lining material in a situation of high pyrethroid resistance
frequency. The following treatments were tested:


1. Untreated Net with 6 holes

2. Pyrethroid LLIN (PermanetH 2.0 Vestergaard Frandsen,
Switzerland), with 6 holes
3. Pyrethroid DL (ZeroVectorH, Vestergaard Frandsen, Switzerland)on walls and ceilings+Pyrethroid LLIN with 6 holes

4. P-methyl NWH on walls and ceilings+Pyrethroid LLIN with 6
holes


Treatment of materials

The DL was 50% shade cloth made of woven high density
polyethylene (HDPE) plastic (Capatex Ltd, UK). The NWH was
100 denier nylon netted fabric purchased from the local market.
These materials were treated at 1 g/m [2] with micro-encapsualted
primiphos methyl (p-methyl) CS (ActellicH 300CS [PP511 CS])
provided by Syngenta. The insecticide was applied onto the plastic
sheets by spraying with a Hudson Xpert knapsack sprayer and to
nettings by hand dipping. Treated materials were left to dry for
24 hours in the shade before being set up in the experimental huts.
Pyrethroid treated DL used in the study was HDPE woven fibre
sheet factory treated with deltamethrin at 175 mg/m [2] . The LLIN
(PermanetH 2.0, Vestergaard Frandsen, Switzerland) was
WHOPES approved, made of polyester fibres, factory-coated
with a wash- resistant formulation of deltamethrin at a target dose
of 55 mg/m [2] . To simulate wear and tear, bednets were
intentionally holed with six 16 cm [2] diameter holes (4 at the sides
and 2 at the ends) according to WHOPES guidelines.


Setting up treated materials to walls
In order to minimise contamination of the hut walls when

rotating the treatments, a removable underlying layer of untreated
material (plastic lining) was used to separate the walls from the
treated materials and these were rotated along with the respective
treatments. Treated plastic sheeting were pinned to small battens
that had been nailed unto the walls while treated netting were
hung unto nails fitted at the edges of the ceiling. These methods of
fixing the treated materials unto the walls also allowed the
treatments to be easily rotated between huts on a weekly basis.


Rotation of sleepers and treatments
Treatments were allocated to the six experimental huts and
rotated each week using a randomised Latin square design to
adjust for any differential positional attractiveness of the huts.
Weekly rotation with one day for cleaning between rotations
minimised any carry over effect between the treatments. Six adult
men served as volunteer sleepers to attract mosquitoes into the
huts. They were rotated between huts on successive nights to
adjust for any variation in individual attractiveness to mosquitoes.
They slept in the huts from 20:00 to 05:00 each night. Mosquitoes
were collected each morning at 05:00 from under bed nets, floors,
walls, ceilings and verandas using collection tubes and torches.
The collections were transported to the laboratory where
mosquitoes were identified to species and scored as blood fed or
unfed and live or dead. Live mosquitoes were held in netted plastic
cups and supplied with 10% glucose solution and delayed



Combining Vector Control Interventions


mortality was recorded after 24 h. Male mosquitoes were not
scored.


Entomological Outcomes
The entomological impact of each treatment in this study was
expressed in terms of the following entomological outcomes;


1. Deterrence: percentage reduction in the number of mosquitoes
caught in treated hut relative to the number caught in the
control hut

2. Exiting rates due to potential irritant effect of treatments
expressed as percentage of the mosquitoes collected from the
veranda trap

3. Inhibition of blood feeding: reduction in blood feeding rate
relative to the control. This was as follows:


% Blood{feeding inhibition~ [100][(][B][f][u][{][B][f][t][)]
Bfu


Where Bfu is the proportion of blood-fed mosquitoes in the

4. Mortality: percentage of dead mosquitoes in treated hut at the
time of collection and after a 24 h holding period corrected for
control mortality.

5. The personal protective effect of the treatments which is
described by a reduction in the number of blood-fed
mosquitoes relative to the control hut was calculated as follows:


% Personal Protection~ [100][(][Bu][{][Bt][)]
Bu


Where Bu = is the number of blood-fed mosquitoes in the
untreated control huts and Bt is the number of blood-fed

mosquitoes in the huts with insecticide treatments.

6. The overall insecticidal effect of a treatment relative to the

number of mosquitoes that would ordinarily enter an untreated
control hut was estimated by using the following formula and
expressed as a percentage:


Overall insecticidal effect %ð Þ [100] (T [(] u [K] { [t] [{] K [K] u ) [u] [)]


where K t is the number killed in the treated hut, K u is the
number dying in the untreated control hut, and T u is the total
number collected from the control hut.


Residual activity of insecticide treatments
To measure residual activity, WHO cone bioassays were
undertaken on treated materials in situ using the laboratorysusceptible An. gambiae s.s. Kisumu strain. Adult females 3–5 days
old were introduced into cones fixed to treated plastic sheeting/net
wall hangings (for 30 minutes) and LLINs (for 3 minutes)
according to WHO guidelines [22]. For each trial, approximately
40–50 adult females were tested in batches of 10 mosquitoes on
each type of treated material each week. These were held in netted
plastic cups, provided 10% glucose solution and mortality
recorded after 24 hours.


Studies on selection of insecticide resistance genes
Samples of An gambiae (dead and alive) collected from the
respective experimental hut treatments through the course of the



PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e83897


trials were preserved for molecular analysis. Only samples from
the first and second experimental hut trial were analysed. These
mosquitoes were systematically selected from the alive and dead
collections of the first trial to cover the entire period of the trial
and to include equal numbers of bloodfed and unfed mosquitoes.
For the second trial, because the numbers entering the huts had
reduced, we analysed all samples collected. Genomic DNA was
extracted using the Livak procedure [23]. Samples were identified
to species and molecular form of An gambiae using SINE-PCR.
Molecular detection of the kdr (L1014F) and ace-1 [R] (G119S)
mutation alleles was carried out by real-time Taqman PCR as
described by Bass et al [24].


Statistical analysis
The effects of the different experimental hut treatments on each
of the main entomological outcomes (bloodfeeding, exophily and
mortality) were assessed using binomial generalised linear mixed
models (GLMMs) with a logit link function, fitted using the ‘lme4’
package for R. A separate model was fitted for each outcome. In
addition to the fixed effect of each treatment, each model included
random effects to account for the following sources of variation:
between the 6 huts used in the studies; between the 6 sleepers who
slept in the huts; between the 6 weeks of the trial; and finally an
observation-level random effect to account for variation not

explained by the other terms in the model (overdispersion). In
comparing fixed effects between treatments, the binomial GLMM
cannot estimate mortalities of exactly 0 or 100%, because the
logits of 0 and 1 are undefined. Some treatments caused 100%
mortality during the second hut trial; hence it was not possible to
fit a valid GLMM to this data. To overcome this problem, a small
constant (0.5) was added to rows contributing to zero cell counts in
this data before modelling the GLMM, allowing conservative
estimates of treatment effects and p-values to be derived [25]. The
numbers entering the huts were analysed using negative binomial
regression.
For genotyping data, differences in survival of resistant
genotypes for each treatment was analysed by Chi square and
Fisher’s exact test. All analyses were performed using R version
2.12.2 for Windows [26].


Ethics Statement

Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Ethics
Review Board of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine (Approval No. 5872) and from the ‘Comite d’Ethique
pour la Recherches en Sante’ (Approval No. 2011-6-33) of the
Ministry of Scientific Research of Burkina Faso. Permission to use
the experimental hut station was obtained from Centre Muraz.
Written informed consent was obtained from the volunteers who

slept in the experimental huts to attract mosquitoes.


Results


Susceptibility tests
An gambiae from Valley du Kou 5 was very resistant to
pyrethroids recording 2% mortality with deltamethrin (0.5%)
treated papers (Table 1). In contrast, mortality with pirimiphos
methyl (0.25%) treated papers was 100% showing that the vector
population was largely susceptible to the organophosphate
(Table 2).


Experimental hut trials
Over 5000 An gambiae ss were collected from the experimental
huts during the trials. The numbers of Culex quinquefasciatus
collected were too few to permit further analysis.



Combining Vector Control Interventions


1. Single intervention trial: A total of 3933 An gambiae ss were
collected from the experimental huts during the trial. The
results obtained are presented in Table 3 and Figure 1. Bloodfeeding rates were generally high (70–83%) with the DL and
NWH alone (Figure 1) since mosquitoes would normally feed
on the person sleeping in the hut before resting on the wall.
Hence the treatments provided limited blood-feeding inhibition
(4–20%) and personal protection (29–56%) (Table 3). Mortality
with pyrethroid DL was 40% (Figure 1). P-methyl treated DL
and NWH induced much higher mortality rates (.95%) than
pyrethroid DL (P,0.001). With only walls covered, p-methyl
DL and NWH showed a similar performance. Highest
mortality was attained when all hut surfaces (walls and ceiling)
were covered with p-methyl NWH (99%) and hence for the
follow on trials, the p-methyl DL and NWH treatments tested
were applied on walls and ceiling.

2. First combined intervention trial: A total of 320 An
gambiae ss were collected from the experimental huts during
the second trial, far fewer than in the first trial. By this time, the
rice in the fields had grown significantly and covered the
breeding sites leading to lower numbers of mosquitoes entering
the huts compared to the first trial. The results obtained in this

methyl DL and NWH with LLINs reduced bloodfeeding rates
significantly (8–9% bloodfed) compared to p-methyl DL and
NWH alone (Figure 2) (P,0.001). The combination therefore
provided more bloodfeeding inhibition (90–91%) and personal
protection (94–95%) than the p-methyl treatments alone (50%
bloodfeeding inhibition and 51–70% personal protection)
(Table 4). Mortality with the LLIN alone was 60% (Figure 2).
Mortality was 100% when p-methyl DL and NWH where used
whether alone or in combination with LLINs.

3. Second combined intervention trial: The results are

presented in Table 5 and Figure 3. A total of 490 An gambiae ss
were collected from the experimental huts during this trial
(Table 5). Combining LLINs with pyrethroid DL did not show
any improvement in mortality (48%) compared to the LLIN
alone (44%) and pyrethroid DL alone (40%) (P.0.1) (Figure 3).
Mortality was much higher (95%) when p-methyl DL was
combined with LLINs.


Residual activity of insecticide
Mortality of laboratory reared susceptible An gambiae (Kisumu)
tested in WHO cone bioassay on p-methyl DL and NWH, was
100% for the first 3–4 weeks of each of the trial but declined to 60–

70% by the end of the trial. With pyrethroid DL, mortality
remained 100% throughout the trial owing to the fact that the
pyrethroid DL was factory coated using long-lasting technology.


Selection of resistance alleles and genotypes
The An gambiae population was predominantly of the Mmolecular form. Of 559 An gambiae samples which were randomly
selected from weekly collections from the experimental huts during
the trials, 98% were identified as belonging to the M-form of An
gambiae ss.
A total of 732 and 656 An gambiae samples collected from the
first two experimental hut trials were analysed for kdr and ace 1 [R]

respectively. The summary results on allele frequencies in live and
dead collections are presented in Table 6. Genotype survival rates
are presented in Table 7. The overall kdr allele frequency was 0.95



PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e83897


Combining Vector Control Interventions



(n = 535) in the first trial and 0.86 (n = 197) in the second trial
while the overall ace-1 [R] allele frequency was 0.01 (n = 429) in the
first trial and 0.03 (n = 228) in the second trial. There was no
difference in the frequency of kdr alleles between live and dead
collections from any of the treatments (P.0.05) (Tables 6).
Analysis of genotype frequency (Table 7) showed that survival of
the kdr heterozygotes (47% was no different from that of kdr
homogygotes for resistance (52%) in the presence of LLIN (1 [st]

trial: P = 0.71, 2 [nd] trial: P = 0.54).
While the ace-1 [R] was low, there was generally a greater tendency
for mosquitoes bearing the ace-1 [R] allele to survive in huts with the
p-methyl treatments alone in the single intervention trial. The ace1 [R] allele frequency was significantly higher in mosquitoes which
survived in huts in which p-methyl treated DL and NWH were
applied alone on walls and ceiling (P#0.03) (Table 6). Analysis of
genotype frequency showed that 100% (9/9) of ace-1 [R] heterozygotes survived the p-methyl treatments but only 32% (105/323) of
ace-1 susceptibles survived (P = 0.001), indicating strong selection
for the ace-1 [R] resistance with the p-methyl interventions. In the
second trial, all mosquitoes which entered the huts with p-methyl
treatments whether applied alone or in combination with LLINs
were killed (100% mortality). It was thus not possible to clearly
demonstrate whether the combination prevents selection of the
ace-1 [R] gene compared to the single intervention of p-methyl
(Tables 6 and 7). The low survival of kdr with the combination
indicates that the p-methyl component might prevent the further
selection of kdr resistance (Table 7).


Discussion


In the current study, p-methyl treated DL and NWH
outperformed pyrethroid treated DL by killing almost all malaria
vectors which entered the huts. This superior performance was
due to the fact that the vector population was very resistant to
pyrethroids but susceptible to organophosphates. As pyrethroid
resistance continues to spread, the use of non-pyrethroids like
organophosphates and carbamates for IRS is increasing. With the
exception of the newly developed micro-encapsulated formulation
of p-methyl which lasts up to 9 months on cement walls [10], most
organophosphate and carbamate insecticides though very toxic to
mosquitoes are unfortunately short-lived when applied as IRS (2–4
months) compared to pyrethroids (up to 6 months) [17]. The
development of long-lasting versions of p-methyl DL and NWH
with residual activity over a number of years could significantly



improve the usefulness of organophosphates in malaria vector
control and enhance capacity to interrupt malaria transmission.
Increasing the level of wall coverage with p-methyl DL and
NWH from walls only to walls plus ceiling did not have a major
effect on the performance of these treatments in the experimental
huts. Similar findings have been previously reported with
pyrethroid DL [7]. This has positive implications for the scalability
of these interventions since covering only walls as opposed to
covering walls and ceilings is likely to be easier owing to the
additional costs and practical difficulty of having to cover ceilings
too. Pyrethroid DL was however found to induce significantly
lower mortality when applied to two walls (20%) compared to all
four walls (45%) [7]. It will be useful to investigate the
performance of p-methyl DL and NWH when lower levels of
wall coverage are achieved.
LLINs are capable of inducing high levels of mortality and
providing significant personal protection to the user against a fully
susceptible vector population. However, when faced with pyrethroid resistance, the insecticidal efficacy of the LLIN is
significantly reduced, and the strength of the intervention may
be compromised [8]. Nevertheless, with limited holes, LLINs may
still provide partial protection against pyrethroid resistant vectors
as shown in this study partly due to the physical barrier of the bed
net and partly to the repellent property of the pyrethroid in the
LLIN, and are thus much better than untreated nets or no nets at
all. The current study demonstrates that the combining of pmethyl DL and NWH with LLINs induced high levels of mortality
in a pyrethroid resistant population of malaria vectors and thus
should restore transmission control to levels which cannot be

achieved by the LLIN alone due to pyrethroid resistance.
Mosquitoes would normally enter the room and feed on the
sleeper before landing on the walls where they pick up the
insecticide. The combination therefore showed potential to control
transmission, largely due to the p-methyl DL and NWH
components, and provide personal protection mainly due to the
LLIN component. As with most IRS and IRS-like treatments,
significant personal protection cannot be expected with p-methyl
DL and NWH alone if only individual households are lined.
However, if entire villages are covered, community protection
should arise from the control of mosquito populations as occurs
with IRS campaigns.
In contrast to p-methyl DL, combining pyrethroid DL and
LLIN in the same hut did not show any improvement in mortality
when compared to the LLIN alone. This can be attributed to the
high level of pyrethroid resistance in the vector population and

served as a positive control to demonstrate the importance of a
non-resisted insecticide in the durable lining or NWH intervention. The present study confirms the fact that combining
pyrethroid DL with pyrethroid LLIN for improved control of
malaria transmission by a vector population which is resistant to
pyrethroids may be a futile attempt and might not warrant the
resources invested. Theoretical models suggest that the increased
repellency posed by the additional pyrethroid wall treatment in the
combination hut may also have decreased the chances of insect
contact with insecticide [27]. The combining of pyrethroid IRS or
IRS-like treatments with pyrethroid LLINs is generally not
encouraged mostly because it exposes local vector populations to
more intense selection pressure for pyrethroid resistance genes [9].
However some vector control programmes may continue to



deploy pyrethroid IRS together with LLINs in the hope of
improving transmission control. The performance of such a
combination is likely to diminish if pyrethroid resistance exists in
the targeted vector population and the threat of stronger resistance
developing is more probable.
The frequency of the kdr (L1014F) mutation in An gambiae in
Vallee du Kou 5 as observed in the current study was very high
(0.89) and had increased remarkably from 0.28 in 2005 [28]. This
confirms the rapid spread of the kdr among An gambiae populations
across sub-Saharan Africa. Population genetic models suggest that
the benefits of insecticide resistance management can be best
achieved while resistance is still rare compared to when it is well
established [20,29,30]. The high kdr allele frequency in the vector
population could not permit a robust investigation into selection

evidence that selection of heterozygotes for kdr was no greater than
selection of homozygotes for kdr and that selection of both
genotypes would be delayed by the addition of p-methyl to an
existing LLIN intervention. Meanwhile, mosquitoes bearing the
ace-1 [R] mutation were more likely to survive in huts when p-methyl
DL and NWH were applied on walls and ceilings and no LLIN
was in use. Because no live mosquitoes were collected from huts in
the trial where p-methyl DL and NWH applied alone were
compared with the combination of p-methyl DL/NWH and
LLINs, it was not possible to demonstrate unequivocally the
selective advantage or neutrality of resistance genes in the
combination. But on the other hand there was similarly no
evidence to indicate that any of the resistance alleles would be
differentially selected by the combination, which is fair argument
for applying the combination. There could also have been



metabolic mechanisms of insecticide resistance in the vector

population which in addition to the kdr may have contributed to
the levels of phenotypic resistance to pyrethroids that was
observed. Unfortunately, the absence of reliable DNA markers
for the collection genes than can be up-regulated in metabolic
resistance could not permit a realistic investigation into their
selection in the current study. Apart from the resistance
management potential, the study clearly shows that the combination would be a better option for controlling and providing
protection against a vector population which is mostly resistant to
pyrethroids but mostly susceptible to organophosphates than the
single treatments alone. Considering the increasing reports of
organophosphate resistance in malaria vectors in West Africa [31–
33], there is opportunity to monitor what happens when the
combination is deployed against a vector population which is
partially resistant to both insecticides.

Residual activity with p-methyl treated DL and NWH declined
over the course of the six weeks trials. This decline was faster than

expected given the slow-release micro-encapsulated formulation of
the insecticide used. The insecticide particles may have flaked off
the treated materials during the course of the study. The study was
designed as a proof of concept and the observed effect of p-methyl
DL and NWH on mortality during these short term trials showed
that mosquitoes will readily rest on p-methyl treated plastic wall
linings and net wall hangings and be killed in the process. To
maximise the benefits of these tools over IRS, the final product will
need to have a residual activity that lasts for years rather than
months. Advanced binding or incorporation technology needs to
be developed to enable the development of a long lasting version of
these tools.



Net wall hangings probably due to their light weight were much
easier to hang on the walls than fixing of DL. Thus net wall
hangings are potentially a more practical means of delivering
insecticides indoors. Netting material is cheap and widely
available. Treated NWH can be readily used in homes where
IRS is short lived on mud walls. Treated wall netting can also be
used to cover eave gaps as to reduce mosquito entry into the home.
Small scale randomised trials are desirable to further assess

the efficacy, acceptability and practicability of treated NWH in
homes.


Conclusion

Pirimiphos methyl treated DL and NWH show potential to
provide improved control of pyrethroid resistant malaria vectors

compared to currently available pyrethroid DL or IRS. Combining p-methyl DL/NWH with LLINs provides transmission control
due mainly to the p-methyl DL/NWH component and personal
protection due mainly to the LLIN component. Community wide
protection and epidemiological impact are expected if p-methyl
DL/NWH are deployed in combination with LLINs against
vector populations which are partly or mostly resistant to
pyrethroids but mostly susceptible to organophosphates. There
was clear evidence from the hut trial that the single intervention
would select for resistance to kdr and ace-1 [R] and some evidence that



the combination intervention would not select so strongly
for resistance. NWH are a practical means of delivering
insecticides indoors and need to be further explored. Advanced
binding or incorporation technology is required to develop
genuine long-lasting p-methyl DL or NWH and produce benefits
over IRS.
