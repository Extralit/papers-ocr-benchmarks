            "\n",
            "Background: To increase the effectiveness of insecticide-treated nets (ITN) in areas of high resistance, new longlasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) called new-generation nets have been developed. These nets are treated with the piperonyl butoxide (PBO) synergist which inhibit the action of detoxification enzymes. The effectiveness of the new-generation nets has been proven in some studies, but their specific effect on mosquitoes carrying detoxification enzymes and those carrying both detoxification enzymes and the knock-down resistance gene in Benin is not well known. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of LLINs treated with PBO on multi-resistant Anopheles gambiae s.l.\n",
            "\n",
            "Methods: The study occurred in seven cities in Benin, Abomey, Cotonou, Porto-Novo, Zangnanado, Parakou, Malanville and Tanguiéta, and included ten locations selected on a north-south transect. Mosquito larvae were collected from these sites, and adult females from these larvae were exposed to single-pyrethroid-treated nets (LifeNet, PermaNet 2.0, Olyset Net) and bi-treated nets (PermaNet 3.0 and Olyset Plus) based on their level of resistance and using WHO cone tests following WHO guidelines.\n",
            "\n",
            "Results: The different LLINs showed 100% mortality of the susceptible laboratory strain Kisumu and the resistant strain Ace-1R Kisumu. However, with the resistant laboratory strain kdr-Kisumu, mortality was low (16-32%) for all LLINs except PermaNet 3.0 (82.9%). The mortality of local strains carrying only the kdr mechanism varied from 0 to 47% for the single-pyrethroid-treated LLINs and 9 to 86% for bi-treated LLINs. With local strains carrying several mechanisms of resistance (kdr + detoxification enzymes), the observed mortality with different LLINs was also low except for PermaNet 3.0, which induced significantly higher mortality, usually greater than 75% (p &lt; 0.001), with multiresistant strains. The inhibition of the mortalities induced by the LLINs (11-96%) on multi-resistant field populations was similar to the inhibition observed with the laboratory strain carrying only the knock-down resistance mechanism (kdr-Kisumu) (p &gt; 0.05).\n",
            "\n",
            "Conclusion: This study showed that the new-generation LLINs treated with pyrethroids and PBO showed better efficacy compared to conventional LLINs. Although the addition of PBO significantly increased the mortality of mosquitoes, the significant role of the kdr resistance gene in the low efficacy of LLINs calls for LLIN technology innovation that specifically targets this mechanism.\n",

            "\n",
            "Malaria  is  a  major  public  health  problem  worldwide, and  particularly  so  in  Benin.  It  remains  a  permanent threat  from  its  high  morbidity  (214  million)  and  mortality (438,000). Africa is  the  most  endemic  region affected  (395,000  deaths  per  year)  [1].  It  affects  onefifth  of  the  world  population.  However,  this  proportion has  decreased  significantly  by  37%  between  2000  and 2015  due  to  the  effect  of  malaria  prevention  and  treatment  methods,  including  long-lasting  insecticidal  nets (LLINs), indoor residual spraying of residual insecticides (IRS),  chemo-prevention  for  pregnant  women  and  children,  and  therapeutic  treatment  with  artemisinin-based combinations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Among these prevention methods, LLINs have emerged in  recent  years  as  a  privileged  tool  to  prevent malaria.  The  insecticides  selected  by  the  World  Health Organization  (WHO)  for  LLIN  treatment  are  pyrethroids,  which  have  little  toxicity  to  humans,  are  effective  at  low  doses,  are  fast  acting  (knock-down  effect) and, along with repellants, have an irritant effect [2]. The Abuja Conference, which brought together all the leaders of Africa and other UN representative states, donors and NGOs in April 2000, gave impetus to a political commitment to the fight against malaria with the use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) [3]. Efforts are being made to increase accessibility for populations, especially pregnant women and  children  under  five,  who  are  vulnerable  to malaria,  a  major  cause  of  perinatal  mortality,  low  birth weight and maternal anaemia [1].\n",
            "\n",
            "Several  research  studies  have  been  conducted  and have shown the effectiveness of ITNs in the fight against malaria in Burkina Faso [4], Cameroon [5], Gambia [69],  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo  [10],  Kenya  [11], Ghana [12], Benin [13] and Côte d'Ivoire [14].\n",
            "\n",
            "However,  several  studies  have  shown  that Anopheles gambiae s.l.  has  developed  strong  resistance  to  pyrethroids and DDT in Benin, with a very high knock-down resistance frequency of approximately 80% in the urban areas of Cotonou and in rural areas [15-23].\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite this resistance developed by An. gambiae s.l. to pyrethroids,  LLINs  remain  effective  in  vector  resistance areas [24] and provide protection through their mechanical barrier role [25]. However, Asidi et al. [26] showed a decrease in their effectiveness in areas of high resistance of Anopheles in southern Benin. Major developed resistance  mechanisms  are  the  targets  of  modification  ( kdr resistance  and ace -1R )  and  metabolic  resistance  (overexpression of detoxification enzymes, oxidases, esterases, GST)  [27].  The kdr mutation  is  associated  with  pyrethroid and DDT resistance, and ace -1R is associated with organophosphate  and  carbamate  resistance  (two  classes of insecticides which are not used to treat LLINs) [15, 28].\n",
            "\n",
            "To increase the effectiveness of ITNs in areas of high resistance, new nets treated with a so-called new-generation of chemicals has been developed. They are treated with  a  synergist  called  piperonyl  butoxide  (PBO).  For some  LLINs,  the  PBO  is  used  on  all  sides  of  the  net (Olyset  Plus ® ).  For  others,  only  the  upper  part  of  the net  is  processed  (PermaNet ® 3.0).  The  principle  of  an ITN  synergist  is  to  inhibit  the  action  of  detoxification enzymes,  which  will  result  in  increasing  the  effectiveness  of  the  insecticide  against  resistant  populations  of mosquitoes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Evidence  of  the  efficacy  of  PermaNet  3.0  has  been shown  in  some  studies,  particularly  in  Tanzania  [29], but  we  do  not  know  its  specific  action  on  mosquitoes carrying  detoxification  enzymes  and  on  those  carrying both detoxification and kdr mechanisms in West Africa, particularly  in  Benin.  There  have  been  limited  data  on the bio-efficacy of new-generation LLINs against multiresistant mosquitoes in Africa in general and particularly in  Benin.  Thus,  the  objective  of  this  study  is  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  long-lasting  insecticidal  nets  (LLINs) treated  with  PBO  on  multi-resistant An.  gambiae s.l. populations  in  Benin.  It  aims  to  assess  the  bio-efficacy of  LLINs  in  areas  with  a  high  frequency  of  molecular resistance genes ( kdr and ace -1R ) and over-expression of detoxification  enzymes  (oxidases,  esterases,  GST).  The efficacy of the new-generation LLINs against pyrethroidresistant Anopheles was also compared to that of conventional LLINs.\n",

            "This study is transversal and compares variability of the efficacy of two different types of LLINs against An. gambiae s.l. carrying kdr resistance mutations and detoxification enzymes in Benin. The two types of LLINs included conventional LLINs only treated with pyrethroids (Olyset Net,  LifeNet,  and  PermaNet  2.0)  and  a  second  type  of new-generation LLIN treated with pyrethroids and piperonyl  butoxide  (PBO),  which  inhibits  the  action  of enzymes, particularly oxidases.\n",

            "The  study  was  conducted  in  Benin,  a  West  African country from June 2015 to March 2016. Among the 12 departments  of  Benin  surveyed,  seven  were  selected  in this  study  (Atlantique,  Littoral,  Oueme,  Zou,  Borgou, Atacora and Alibori).

            "Several studies have shown a decrease in the bio-efficacy  of  LLINs  against  local  pyrethroid-resistant  vectors [34, 35]. The effectiveness of LLINs treated only with deltamethrin (PermaNet 2.0 and LifeNet) was found to be significantly lower compared to that of nets treated with deltamethrin and PBO. The same observation was made with the LLINs treated with permethrin only (Olyset Net) and  those  treated  with  permethrin  and  PBO.  However, the  effectiveness  of  LLINs  treated  with  permethrin  was generally lower than that of LLINs treated with deltamethrin, with lower mortality and a very slow knock-down\n",

            "time (KDT 50 and 95%) compared to other LLINs. In a recent study conducted in Benin [36], Olyset Plus, treated with permethrin + PBO, demonstrated a higher efficacy than Olyset Net against wild multi-resistant An. gambiae s.l. in experimental huts, as observed in WHO cone tests used in the present study. In south-western Ethiopia [35] and in Uganda [34], a reduced efficacy of mono-treated LLINs was also observed against wild resistant An. gambiae s.l.  in  comparison  with  Permanet  3.0  treated  with deltamethrin + PBO.  The  results  are  similar  to  those observed  in  this  study.  However,  these  studies  did  not include  Olyset  Plus,  the  second  type  of  new-generation LLINs treated with permethrin + PBO.\n",
            "\n",
            "The reduced efficacy of LLINs treated with permethrin would be related to the strong resistance of the local vectors  to  permethrin due to the resistance selection pressures generated by the use of the same class of insecticide for  malaria  vector  control  in  public  health  and  for  pest control in agriculture [16, 17, 23, 37, 38].\n",
            "\n",
            "The comparison of LLIN bio-efficacy performed in this study  provides  the  necessary  information  for  the  selection of appropriate LLINs for mass distribution. The optimal and constant efficacy of PermaNet 3.0 LLINs on all vector  populations  shows  that  this  combination  of  deltamethrin and PBO on LLINs is a most successful strategy against pyrethroid resistance in Benin. Variations in the  mortality  of  vectors  also  showed  that  certain  types of LLINs are more appropriate than others for distribution  in  specific  regions.  This  is  related  to  the  fact  that the effectiveness of an LLIN depends on the characteristics of the mosquito population tested and the chemical structure of the molecule (insecticide) used.\n",
            "\n",
            "The mosquito populations assessed in the present study were characterized by a high frequency of the kdr gene. This high frequency was probably due to the massive use of pyrethroids in agriculture and public health. In some areas,  such  as  Tanguieta,  Parakou,  Houeyiho,  Akron, and  Ladji,  farmers  and  gardeners  use  huge  amounts  of insecticides to reduce pests in their crops, which explains the presence and strong expression of several resistance mechanisms in the mosquito populations [39, 40]. Overproduction of resistance enzymes in these areas would be linked to pressure on mosquito larvae from insecticides used by farmers to protect vegetable crops [41-43]. This expression of the kdr resistance gene induced a 17-84% reduction  in  LLIN  efficacy  against  laboratory  strains. These frequencies are similar to those observed in natural  populations  of An.  gambiae s.l.  This  observation shows that the kdr gene is the main mechanism involved in the reduction of the effectiveness of LLINs. Although detoxification  enzymes  contribute  to  resistance,  their impact is successfully inhibited by the presence of PBO on new-generation LLINs and the remaining part is more likely related to the presence of kdr gene in the mosquito populations.  This  also  suggests  that  the  search  for  new molecules or combinations of molecules that target the kdr resistance mechanism should be promoted.\n",
            "\n",
            "The  WHO  recommends  preventive  measures  against vector resistance to insecticides [44]. The results of this study  therefore  constitute  important  evidence  that  can guide decision making in the selection and distribution of high efficacy LLINs in specific regions of Benin. The use of LLINs that showed high bio-efficacy against the local vector  populations  should  be  encouraged  to  contribute substantively to reducing the transmission of malaria in Benin.\n",
            "\n",
            "This study also suggests the need to develop a routine for  monitoring  the  bio-efficacy  of  LLINs  against  local malaria vectors for the replacement of ineffective LLINs. However, community studies would be needed to evaluate the epidemiological impact of these LLINs to confirm whether or not the low efficacy observed is followed by a loss of the epidemiological impact of these nets.\n",
            "\n",
            "Although  the  important  results  of  this  study,  it  had certain  limitations.  Strong  evaluation  would  have  been possible  if  tunnel  tests  were  conducted  on  LLINs  that did  not  meet  the  criteria  of  80%  mortality  with  resistant mosquito strains. In addition, a chemical analysis of the LLINs prior to the start of the study would also have improved  the  quality  of  the  results.  However,  all  the LLINs demonstrated a good performance with susceptible laboratory stain Kisumu (mortality &gt; 80%), as recommended by WHO [45], and the focus of this study was to  demonstrate the important role of resistance mechanisms on LLINs efficacy.\n",

            "\n",
            "This study showed variable effectiveness of LLINs on An. gambiae s.l. populations from different localities surveyed from north to south in Benin. The new-generation LLINs with pyrethroids and PBO (PermaNet 3.0 and Olyset Plus) showed  higher  efficacy  than  conventional  LLINs  (PermaNet 2.0, LifeNet and Olyset net). However, the strong resistance of local vectors to permethrin suggests that the combination of deltamethrin + PBO is the most appropriate  strategy  against  local  vectors  in  Benin.  Although  the addition of PBO (targeting many biochemical mechanisms of resistance) significantly increased the mortality of mosquitoes,  the  significantly  high  role  of  the kdr resistance gene in the low efficacy of LLINs calls for LLIN technology innovation that specifically targets this mechanism.\n",

OFULLA.<sup>2</sup> J. I. GITHURE<sup>2</sup> and R. W. SNOW<sup>1,3</sup>\n\n<sup>1</sup> Clinical Research Centre and <sup>2</sup> Biomedical Sciences Research Centre, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), Kenya, and <sup>3</sup> Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, Oxford University, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, U.K.\n\n> **Abstract.** The effects of introducing permethrin-impregnated bednets on local populations of the malaria vector mosquitoes Anopheles funestus and the An.gambiae complex was monitored during a randomized controlled trial at Kilifi on the Kenyan coast. Pyrethrum spray collections inside 762 households were conducted between May 1994 and April 1995 after the introduction of bednets in half of the study area. All-night human bait collections were performed in two zones (one control and one intervention) for two nights each month during the same period. PCR identifications of An gambiae sensulato showed that proportions of sibling species were An gambiae sensu  $stricto > An.merus > An. arabiensis.$\n\n> Indoor-resting densities of An.gambiae s.l. and the proportion of engorged females decreased significantly in intervention zones as compared to control zones. However, the human blood index and *Plasmodium falciparum* sporozoite rate remained unaffected. Also vector parous rates were unaltered by the intervention, implying that survival rates of malaria vectors were not affected. The human-biting density of An.gambiae s.l., the predominant vector, was consistently higher in the intervention zone compared to the control zone, but showed 8% reduction compared to pre-intervention biting rates - versus 94% increase in the control zone.\n\n> Bioassay, susceptibility and high-performance liquid chromatography results all indicated that the permethrin content applied to the nets was sufficient to maintain high mortality of susceptible vectors throughout the trial. Increased rates of early outdoorbiting, as opposed to indoor-biting later during the night, were behavioural or vector composition changes associated with this intervention, which would require further monitoring during control programmes employing insecticide-treated bednets.\n\n> **Key words.** Anopheles arabiensis, An.funestus, An.gambiae, An.merus, malaria, permethrin-impregnated bednets, mosquito nets, Kenya Coast.\n\n## Introduction\n\nBednets (mosquito nets) are traditionally used to ward off mosquitoes and have been advocated as a means of personal protection against malaria vectors in Africa (W.H.O., 1986). However, torn or incorrectly tucked nets provide little additional protection and mosquitoes are adept at feeding through nets on exposed limbs (Port & Boreham, 1982). For these reasons the application of a residual insecticide (of low mammalian toxicity) to bednets was suggested in the late 1970s as a means of reinstating the effectiveness of torn or incorrectly used nets as a\n\nCorrespondence: Dr Charles N. M. Mbogo, Kilifi Research Unit, KEMRI, P.O. Box 230, Kilifi, Kenya.\n\nman-vector barrier (Curtis et al., 1990). Synthetic pyrethroids such as permethrin and deltamethrin, which have high insecticidal and excito-repellant properties, are most suitable for the treatment of bednets and have been adopted in several countries as part of national malaria control activities (Curtis et al., 1990).\n\nMalaria is the single largest cause of death among children living in tropical Africa (World Bank, 1993). Across this continent, the rates of malaria transmission and endemicity levels vary widely. The impact of insecticide-treated bednets (ITBN) upon the vector population's ability to transmit, and hence the degree of personal protection, depend largely upon the intensity of transmission in any given area. Despite encouraging effects of ITBN in reducing both morbidity and mortality among Gambian children by over 60% (Snow et al., 1988; Alonso et al.,\n\n1991), those results apply to an area with low rates of sporozoite challenge with extremely seasonal vector activity (Lindsay et al., 1993). The limitations of recommendations based on one transmission setting prompted the W.H.O. to replicate ITBN trials in several other areas of Africa where transmission characteristics are very different to those of The Gambia.\n\nAccordingly, in July 1993, ITBN were introduced as part of a randomized controlled trial, conducted in coastal Kenya, to examine their role in reducing childhood mortality and severe malaria morbidity (Nevill et al., 1996). This paper reports the entomological context in which the Kenyan trial was conducted and the impact of ITBNs on malaria vectors in the coastal area of Kenya.\n\n## **Materials and Methods**\n\nStudy area. The study area is located in Kilifi district, 60 km north of Mombasa on the Kenyan coast, extending 30 km inland and 40 km along the Indian Ocean coast north of Kilifi town. The area was designated in 1989 for intensive entomological (Mbogo et al., 1993b, 1995), demographic (Snow et al., 1994) and epidemiologic studies (Snow et al., 1993) of malaria. The principal vectors of malaria are the Anopheles gambiae Giles complex with a minor role played by Anopheles funestus Giles. These two vectors yield on average ten sporozoite inoculations per person per year. Among the people inhabiting this geographical area, annual rates of *P.falciparum* challenge range from less than one to sixty per person (Mbogo et al., 1995). Despite these annual rates of *P.falciparum* inoculation being lower than in most parts of tropical Africa, it has been estimated that at least one in fifteen children will develop severe life-threatening malaria before their fifth birthday (Snow et al., 1993).\n\nThe study population comprises approximately 60,000 inhabitants living mainly in traditional style houses (walls of sticks and mud) with a coconut thatch roof. Unscreened windows, holes in the walls and large open eaves provide easy access for mosquitoes. Homesteads are scattered and separated from one another by open farmland. Maize is the staple crop cultivated for home consumption; cashews and coconuts are grown as cash crops. During the 1989 national Kenyan census the study area was divided into seventy-two enumeration zones, of which thirtyeight were randomly allocated to receive ITBN.\n\nGreen polyester 100 denier mosquito nets (SiamDutch, Thailand) were issued to be used over all beds within the intervention zones and impregnated with 25% permethrin (cis:trans 40:60) emulsifiable concentrate (Imperator, ICI, U.K.) to achieve a target dose of 0.5 g of permethrin per  $m<sup>2</sup>$  of netting. Nets were re-impregnated every 6 months to coincide with the two main rainy seasons: in May, the beginning of the long rains; and October, towards onset of the short rains. In the intervention area, people were asked not to wash their nets until immediately before the next re-impregnation. The remaining thirty-four zones served as the contemporaneous non-intervention control area where bednet ownership was less than 6% (Snow et al., 1992).\n\nThe study area was mapped using a hand-held satellite navigational system (Trimble Navigation Europe, U.K.) and computerized using MapInfo<sup>R</sup> software (Troy Ltd, U.S.A.).\n\nEntomological surveillance. One homestead from each zone was randomly sampled for mosquitoes by Pyrethrum spray-catch (PSC) each month (May 1994 to April 1995); no homestead was sampled more than once. Nine zones (five intervention and four control) were excluded from the sampling frame because they formed part of ongoing entomological studies since 1989. Houses were visited in the morning (07.00–11.30 hours) and occupants asked to tie their bednets up away from the bed. White sheets were laid on the floors and the rooms sprayed with pyrethrum aerosol. All mosquitoes knocked down were collected into labelled petri dishes lined with moist cotton wool and taken to the laboratory at Kilifi for further investigation.\n\nPre-intervention all-night catches of human-biting mosquitoes were undertaken once a week at four sentinel households per zone (five intervention and four control), between May 1992 and April 1993. Post-intervention human-bait collections were performed at one control and one intervention zone (drawn from the nine pre-intervention zones and excluded from PSC catches) for two nights each month between May 1994 and April 1995. Pairs of experienced catchers recruited from the study area were positioned either indoors or outdoors at each site and collections made from 18.00 until 07.00 hours. Catchers rotated in shifts and used aspirators and torches to catch mosquitoes which landed on exposed limbs. Each hourly catch was placed into a prelabelled polystyrene container and taken to the laboratory at Kilifi for assessment.\n\nLaboratory procedures. Mosquito species were identified morphologically and scored as unfed, blood-fed or gravid. A proportion of An.gambiae s.l. females collected by both PSC and all-night biting catches were identified to sibling species by the method of polymerase chain reaction, PCR (Paskewitz & Collins, 1990). Primers used were specific for An.gambiae s.s., An.arabiensis and An.merus, members of the An.gambiae complex found at the Kenyan coast (Mosha & Petrarca, 1983). Samples of An.gambiae s.l. collected on human bait were dissected for parity determination as described by Detinova (1962). Mosquitoes collected by PSC were prepared for sporozoite enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing using monoclonal antibodies to detect circumsporozoite proteins of P.falciparum (Wirtz et al., 1987). Tests were assessed visually for positivity (Beier & Koros, 1991). Bloodmeals were identified by direct ELISA using anti-host (IgG) conjugates against human, cow and goat (Beier et al., 1988).\n\nBioassay, bioavailability and susceptibility tests. Nets were randomly selected from intervention households, between 1 and 17 months after they were issued. These nets were visually inspected and coded as either clean or dirty, and for the number of re-impregnations each net had received. Bioassay cones (W.H.O., 1975) were attached to the nets by means of elastic bands whilst the nets were hung upright in the laboratory. Two cones were used, one placed at the top of the net and the other on the lower portion toward the floor. Twenty laboratory-colonized female An. gambiae s.s. were introduced to each cone and exposed to the netting for 3 min before they were removed to paper cups. Delayed mortality was recorded after the mosquitoes had been left in the paper cups for 24 h with adequate sugar water in an ambient temperature of 25°C and a relative humidity of 72%. Four repeats per net were performed. Identical procedures were followed for untreated nets to serve as controls. Mortality was corrected for control mortality where the latter exceeded 20% of exposed mosquitoes.\n\nSample swatches of netting fabric were collected for highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) immediately after nets were impregnated for the first time and 11 months later, after two re-impregnations. HPLC assays were conducted at the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, U.S.A., to determine the concentration of the active cis isomer of permethrin per m<sup>2</sup> of netting.\n\nSusceptibility of wild-caught female mosquitoes, collected from an area adjacent to the study area, was determined in February 1995 using the W.H.O. (1981) test kit and procedure. Unfed An. gambiae s.l. females ( $n = 415$ ) were exposed to 0.25% permethrin test paper for 1 h. Delayed mortality was measured 24 h post-exposure to the permethrin or control papers, and corrected if control mortality exceeded 20%.\n\nStatistical analysis. The mean number of mosquitoes per house was calculated (from PSC data) for each of the zones sampled over the 12 months of surveillance (Table 1). The annual means of the thirty-three intervention zones were compared with the annual means of the thirty control zones using a Mann-Whitney U test (given their non-normal distribution). Human blood indices, sporozoite rates, parity and man-biting rates were analysed post-intervention using a Chi-square test, or controlling for pre-intervention rates using a Mantel Haenzel Chi-square test.\n\n## **Results**\n\nA total of 762 houses were sampled by PSC between May 1994 and April 1995. Of the 362 houses sampled within the nonintervention (control) area, 31.5% (114) yielded at least one An.gambiae s.l. or An.funestus, compared to only 11.3% (45/\n\n400) of the intervention houses sampled during the same period  $(\\chi^2 = 45.9, v = 1, P < 0.001)$ . As described previously (Mbogo et al., 1995), large between-zone variation in vector abundance occurs within this relatively small geographical area (Table 1). Comparing the ranks of the mean zonal densities of either An.gambiae s.l. or An.funestus per house indicates, before intervention, a significant difference of indoor-resting mosquito densities between intervention and non-intervention areas (Mann-Whitney U test,  $P < 0.0001$ ). Overall, post-intervention, there was a nine-fold reduction of the indoor-resting densities of both An.gambiae s.l. and An.funestus associated with ITBN use. Fig. 1 shows that the typical peaks of An.gambiae s.l. density during the long rains (May-August) and the short rains (November-December) were virtually eliminated in areas where ITBN were used.\n\nComposition of the An. gambiae complex differed significantly between non-intervention (control) and ITBN intervention areas (Table 2). Proportions of An.arabiensis, An.gambiae s.s. and An.merus were 7%, 49% and 44% respectively among seventytwo specimens identified by PCR from the intervention area. compared with 11%, 83% and 6% of these three sibling species, respectively, among 165 specimens identified from the nonintervention area. PSC densities of all three species were significantly different both between treatment areas and between species within areas (Table 2). Per house sampled, the intervention area had 2.9-fold more An.merus but 4-fold less An.arabiensis and 4.3-fold less An.gambiae s.s. than the non-intervention (control) area.\n\nIn houses with impregnated bednets, significantly fewer An.gambiae s.l. were found to be blood-fed and their humanblood index was lower than in control houses, although this difference was not statistically significant (Table 3). There were no significant differences between areas in the proportion of An.gambiae s.l. with detectable P.falciparum CS protein and\n\n![](_page_2_Figure_10.jpeg)\n\nFig. 1.

Biting cycle (hourly percentage on human bait) of An gambiae s.l. in houses where ITBN were used (light bars) and in a non-intervention zone where bednets were not used (dark bars).\n\n(deleterious or beneficial effects) entering houses in the control (non-intervention) area close to the intervention area, we used longitude and latitude to establish precise distances from intervention zones of thirty-five houses in control zones 57, 58 and 59, selected because they generated the largest numbers of mosquitoes. Distances were classified as more or less than 400 m from the intervention area. Among eleven households within 400 m, 9% had at least one mosquito, significantly less than 46% of twenty-four households at a distance of more than 400 m from the intervention area. ( $\\chi^2 = 4.5$ ,  $v = 1$ ,  $P < 0.05$ ).\n\nDetails of user compliance of the intervention will be presented elsewhere (Some et al., in prep.). Potency of the permethrin applied to bednets remained high throughout the trial. HPLC analyses of the nets indicated that, following the first treatment, the average concentration of cis-permethrin was  $0.43$  g/m<sup>2</sup> (95% CL 0.34-0.52) on thirty-six nets. Eleven months later, following re-impregnation after 6 months, the average concentration on thirty-six nets was 1.36 g/m<sup>2</sup> (95% CL 1.21-1.51).\n\nTable 4.

(1975) test kits, gave a mortality-rate of 94.5% when tests were undertaken 21 months after the trial began.\n\nBioassay tests with An.gambiae s.l. (3 min exposure, 24 h mortality) on various nets that had been used for up to 8 months following their initial impregnation in July 1993 gave greater than 78% kill (Table 4). Nets re-impregnated in April and November 1994 showed an increased killing capacity of 96-99.8%. Interestingly, nets which were found to be dirty with cooking soot had higher killing effects (94.1%) than nets which were clean  $(84.5\\%)$ .\n\n#### **Discussion**\n\nOur results demonstrate that permethrin-impregnated bednets exert a major impact upon the indoor-resting abundance of the principal vectors of *P.falciparum* malaria in coastal villages of Kenya. Indoor-resting densities of An.gambiae s.l. and An funestus were 9 times lower in houses where ITBN were in use, compared to households where no nets were used. This had the additional effect of eliminating the typical seasonal peaks in vector density usually seen in this part of Kenya (Fig. 1), despite evidence that more of the vector species were biting outdoors (Table 3). These findings are consistent with other studies of synthetic pyrethroid treated bednets or curtains in Africa (Lines et al., 1987; Majori et al., 1987; Lindsay et al., 1989, 1993; Magesa et al., 1991; Robert & Carnevale, 1991; Beach et al., 1993). The precise effect in each of these areas is difficult\n\nto compare, given the inherent differences in the sampling procedures used within each study. We opted not to use light traps (Lines et al., 1991; Mbogo et al., 1993a) in our estimation of vector abundance, because they tend to be less efficient in areas of low vector abundance (such as our study area) and have been shown to over-estimate parity rates in this area of Kenya (Petrarca et al., 1991). Furthermore, we required a simple and rapid means of monitoring endophilic mosquitoes over a wide geographical area, so as to truly reflect the impact of ITBN within our entire study population. Intensive entomological surveillance limited to a few sites – as suggested by the W.H.O.  $(1991)$  – can yield unrepresentative results in areas where marked overdispersion of vectors is common. However, it could be argued that reductions of indoor-resting densities - as determined by PSC - may simply reflect increased excito-repellency of the insecticides and not a reduction in the numbers of vectors coming to feed. Indeed, studies with exit traps in The Gambia have shown an increased rate of exophily due to ITBNs indoors (Snow et al., 1987; Miller et al., 1991). In addition, however, there is clear evidence that houses with pyrethroid-treated fabrics tend to significantly deter entry of vectors into the house (Lines et al., 1987; Lindsay et al., 1991). Further evidence from our study that man-vector contact was reduced is shown by the very highly significantly reduced proportion of An. gambiae s.l. found bloodfed in the early-morning PSC samples (Table 3). Human bait catches, however, revealed no significant reduction in the number of sporozoite inoculations an unprotected individual is likely to receive per year when living in a household where ITBN were used, compared to living in a house where no nets were in use. Whereas the sporozoite inoculation rate increased by 94% in the non-intervention area, for unaccountable (probably climatic) reasons between pre- and post-intervention years, it decreased by 8.3% in the ITBN intervention area, a significant reduction.\n\nInterestingly, our study did not demonstrate a significant reduction in the actual sporozoite rate or parity (an index of longevity) among vectors sampled from ITBN intervention zones compared to non-intervention (control) zones. Similar results were obtained in the Gambia, where bednets were also impregnated with permethrin  $0.5$  g/m<sup>2</sup>, and this has been interpreted as a probable lack of any so called 'mass effect' upon the vector population (Lindsay et al., 1993; Thomson et al., 1995). Mass effects would be difficult to prove in most field study designs, because the intervention could affect mosquito abundance in the untreated (control) as well as treated (ITBN) areas, as shown by the overall reductions compared to pre-intervention data in both The Gambia (Lindsay et al., 1993) and Burkina Faso (Robert & Carnevale, 1991). Hence Lines et al. (1987) and Lindsay et al. (1991) argued that, although individuals appear to be protected by ITBN against the bites of vector mosquitoes, there is no evidence that this increases the biting rate on unprotected neighbours. Under fortuitous circumstances, there may be some reduction of biting on people without ITBN if they are sufficiently closely associated with ITBN users to be afforded some protection. We have tried to assess this 'community protection' by studying three control communities in close proximity to intervention communities, comparing vector abundance by distance from the nearest houses where ITBN were widely employed. This analysis indicated that, within the non-intervention area, fewer houses closest to the intervention area had any malaria\n\nvectors compared to those further away.\n\nThe dipping procedures used for bednet impregnation during this trial provided adequate target treatment concentration of  $0.5$  g/m<sup>2</sup> (over 76% of all netting samples tested had excess of this figure), giving bioassay mortalities in excess of 80% throughout the study, increasing to almost 100% following multiple re-impregnations at half-yearly intervals (Table 4).\n\nPerhaps the greatest concern raised by this study is the observation that a significant proportion of malaria vectors appeared to bite earlier in the evening in houses where ITBN were used, with a greater tendency toward exophagy rather than the typical endophagy of most anthropophilic An gambiae.s.l. Furthermore, there was an apparent shift in sibling species composition of the An gambiae complex following the intro-duction of ITBN. Both An.merus and An.arabiensis have slightly different biting cycles to An. gambiae s.s. (Ivengar, 1962; White, 1974; Mosha & Petrarca, 1983). Earlier biting is associated with use of permethrin-treated bednets in Papua New Guinea (Charlwood & Graves, 1987). As the biting cycle change occurred immediately after installation of ITBNs in our study, in conjunction with the lack of evidence for a mass-killing effect, we conclude that the earlier biting reflects either an immediate intraspecific behavioural effect or a change in vector species proportions within the An.gambiae complex, and was not the result of selection for evolved behavioural resistance. Among our Kenyan study population, people usually 'go to bed' at 21.00-22.00 hours (unpublished data) and most children retire earlier, so their customs limit the opportunities for vectors to bite them, especially when they sleep under bednets. If ITBN are increasingly to be employed against malaria in tropical Africa, their effects on mosquito behaviour and insecticide susceptibility (cf. Vulule et al., 1996) should be monitored.\n\n#### **Acknowledgments**\n\nThis study was supported by funds from the UNDP/World Bank/ W.H.O.
