        "\n",
        "PyMuPDF4LLM is highly efficient for extracting structured text and headers from PDFs, but it can miss headers—sometimes treating them as bolded text rather than true markdown headers. This issue is common in academic papers with complex or inconsistent formatting. Here’s how to address and improve header detection for accurate markdown output.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Headers Are Missed\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Default detection relies on font size**: By default, PyMuPDF4LLM maps larger font sizes to headers. If a document uses bolding or other styles (not size) for headers, these may be missed and rendered as regular or bold text[1][2].\n",
        "- **False negatives**: Headers with the same font size as body text but with different styling (bold, all-caps) are not detected as headers automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Solutions for Accurate Header Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Customize Header Detection Logic**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can provide a custom function to the `hdr_info` parameter in `to_markdown()` to define what counts as a header. This function receives the text span and can use additional properties (e.g., font name, bold status, color) to identify headers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example: Custom Header Detection Using Font Properties**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "\n",
        "def custom_header_logic(span, page=None):\n",
        "    # Example: treat bold, all-caps lines as headers\n",
        "    text = span[\"text\"].strip()\n",
        "    is_bold = \"Bold\" in span.get(\"font\", \"\")\n",
        "    is_all_caps = text.isupper()\n",
        "    font_size = span[\"size\"]\n",
        "\n",
        "    if is_bold and is_all_caps and len(text) > 3:\n",
        "        return \"# \"\n",
        "    elif is_bold and font_size > 12:\n",
        "        return \"## \"\n",
        "    else:\n",
        "        return \"\"\n",

        "- Adjust the logic to match your document’s header style (e.g., check for underline, color, or position)[1].\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Leverage Table of Contents (TOC) for Header Mapping**\n",
        "\n",
        "If your PDF has a TOC/bookmarks, use them to map headers accurately:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "toc = doc.get_toc()\n",
        "\n",
        "def toc_header_logic(span, page=None):\n",
        "    toc_items = [t for t in toc if t[-1] == page.number + 1]\n",
        "    for lvl, title, _ in toc_items:\n",
        "        if span[\"text\"].strip().startswith(title):\n",
        "            return \"#\" * lvl + \" \"\n",
        "    return \"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "md_text = pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(doc, hdr_info=toc_header_logic)\n",
        "```\n",
        "- This approach uses the document’s own hierarchy for maximum accuracy[1].\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Limit or Expand Header Levels**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can set the maximum number of header levels with `max_levels` in the `IdentifyHeaders` class. This helps if the default mapping is too shallow or deep:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from pymupdf4llm import IdentifyHeaders\n",
        "\n",
        "my_headers = IdentifyHeaders(doc, max_levels=4)\n",
        "md_text = pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(doc, hdr_info=my_headers)\n",
        "```\n",
        "- Adjust `max_levels` to fit your needs[1].\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Post-Process Markdown for Missed Headers**\n",
        "\n",
        "If some headers are still missed (e.g., bolded lines without size change), post-process the markdown to promote bold lines to headers using regex or markdown libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Best Practices\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Inspect font properties** in your PDF using `page.get_text(\"dict\")` to see how headers are styled.\n",
        "- **Combine multiple cues**: font size, weight, all-caps, position, and TOC.\n",

Pyrethrum spray collections inside 762 households were conducted between May 1994 and April 1995 after the introduction of bednets in half of the study area. All-night human bait collections were performed in two zones (one control and one intervention) for two nights each month during the same period. PCR identifications of An gambiae sensulato showed that proportions of sibling species were An gambiae sensu  $stricto > An.merus > An. arabiensis.$\n\n> Indoor-resting densities of An.gambiae s.l. and the proportion of engorged females decreased significantly in intervention zones as compared to control zones. However, the human blood index and *Plasmodium falciparum* sporozoite rate remained unaffected. Also vector parous rates were unaltered by the intervention, implying that survival rates of malaria vectors were not affected. The human-biting density of An.gambiae s.l., the predominant vector, was consistently higher in the intervention zone compared to the control zone, but showed 8% reduction compared to pre-intervention biting rates - versus 94% increase in the control zone.\n\n> Bioassay, susceptibility and high-performance liquid chromatography results all indicated that the permethrin content applied to the nets was sufficient to maintain high mortality of susceptible vectors throughout the trial. Increased rates of early outdoorbiting, as opposed to indoor-biting later during the night, were behavioural or vector composition changes associated with this intervention, which would require further monitoring during control programmes employing insecticide-treated bednets.\n\n> **Key words.** Anopheles arabiensis, An.funestus, An.gambiae, An.merus, malaria, permethrin-impregnated bednets, mosquito nets, Kenya Coast.\n\n## Introduction\n\nBednets (mosquito nets) are traditionally used to ward off mosquitoes and have been advocated as a means of personal protection against malaria vectors in Africa (W.H.O., 1986). However, torn or incorrectly tucked nets provide little additional protection and mosquitoes are adept at feeding through nets on exposed limbs (Port & Boreham, 1982). For these reasons the application of a residual insecticide (of low mammalian toxicity) to bednets was suggested in the late 1970s as a means of reinstating the effectiveness of torn or incorrectly used nets as a\n\nCorrespondence: Dr Charles N. M. Mbogo, Kilifi Research Unit, KEMRI, P.O. Box 230, Kilifi, Kenya.\n\nman-vector barrier (Curtis et al., 1990). Synthetic pyrethroids such as permethrin and deltamethrin, which have high insecticidal and excito-repellant properties, are most suitable for the treatment of bednets and have been adopted in several countries as part of national malaria control activities (Curtis et al., 1990).\n\nMalaria is the single largest cause of death among children living in tropical Africa (World Bank, 1993). Across this continent, the rates of malaria transmission and endemicity levels vary widely. The impact of insecticide-treated bednets (ITBN) upon the vector population's ability to transmit, and hence the degree of personal protection, depend largely upon the intensity of transmission in any given area. Despite encouraging effects of ITBN in reducing both morbidity and mortality among Gambian children by over 60% (Snow et al., 1988; Alonso et al.,\n\n1991), those results apply to an area with low rates of sporozoite challenge with extremely seasonal vector activity (Lindsay et al., 1993). The limitations of recommendations based on one transmission setting prompted the W.H.O. to replicate ITBN trials in several other areas of Africa where transmission characteristics are very different to those of The Gambia.\n\nAccordingly, in July 1993, ITBN were introduced as part of a randomized controlled trial, conducted in coastal Kenya, to examine their role in reducing childhood mortality and severe malaria morbidity (Nevill et al., 1996). This paper reports the entomological context in which the Kenyan trial was conducted and the impact of ITBNs on malaria vectors in the coastal area of Kenya.\n\n## **Materials and Methods**\n\nStudy area. The study area is located in Kilifi district, 60 km north of Mombasa on the Kenyan coast, extending 30 km inland and 40 km along the Indian Ocean coast north of Kilifi town. The area was designated in 1989 for intensive entomological (Mbogo et al., 1993b, 1995), demographic (Snow et al., 1994) and epidemiologic studies (Snow et al., 1993) of malaria. The principal vectors of malaria are the Anopheles gambiae Giles complex with a minor role played by Anopheles funestus Giles. These two vectors yield on average ten sporozoite inoculations per person per year. Among the people inhabiting this geographical area, annual rates of *P.falciparum* challenge range from less than one to sixty per person (Mbogo et al., 1995). Despite these annual rates of *P.falciparum* inoculation being lower than in most parts of tropical Africa, it has been estimated that at least one in fifteen children will develop severe life-threatening malaria before their fifth birthday (Snow et al., 1993).\n\nThe study population comprises approximately 60,000 inhabitants living mainly in traditional style houses (walls of sticks and mud) with a coconut thatch roof. Unscreened windows, holes in the walls and large open eaves provide easy access for mosquitoes. Homesteads are scattered and separated from one another by open farmland. Maize is the staple crop cultivated for home consumption; cashews and coconuts are grown as cash crops. During the 1989 national Kenyan census the study area was divided into seventy-two enumeration zones, of which thirtyeight were randomly allocated to receive ITBN.\n\nGreen polyester 100 denier mosquito nets (SiamDutch, Thailand) were issued to be used over all beds within the intervention zones and impregnated with 25% permethrin (cis:trans 40:60) emulsifiable concentrate (Imperator, ICI, U.K.) to achieve a target dose of 0.5 g of permethrin per  $m<sup>2</sup>$  of netting. Nets were re-impregnated every 6 months to coincide with the two main rainy seasons: in May, the beginning of the long rains; and October, towards onset of the short rains. In the intervention area, people were asked not to wash their nets until immediately before the next re-impregnation. The remaining thirty-four zones served as the contemporaneous non-intervention control area where bednet ownership was less than 6% (Snow et al., 1992).\n\nThe study area was mapped using a hand-held satellite navigational system (Trimble Navigation Europe, U.K.) and computerized using MapInfo<sup>R</sup> software (Troy Ltd, U.S.A.).\n\nEntomological surveillance. One homestead from each zone was randomly sampled for mosquitoes by Pyrethrum spray-catch (PSC) each month (May 1994 to April 1995); no homestead was sampled more than once. Nine zones (five intervention and four control) were excluded from the sampling frame because they formed part of ongoing entomological studies since 1989. Houses were visited in the morning (07.00–11.30 hours) and occupants asked to tie their bednets up away from the bed. White sheets were laid on the floors and the rooms sprayed with pyrethrum aerosol. All mosquitoes knocked down were collected into labelled petri dishes lined with moist cotton wool and taken to the laboratory at Kilifi for further investigation.\n\nPre-intervention all-night catches of human-biting mosquitoes were undertaken once a week at four sentinel households per zone (five intervention and four control), between May 1992 and April 1993. Post-intervention human-bait collections were performed at one control and one intervention zone (drawn from the nine pre-intervention zones and excluded from PSC catches) for two nights each month between May 1994 and April 1995. Pairs of experienced catchers recruited from the study area were positioned either indoors or outdoors at each site and collections made from 18.00 until 07.00 hours. Catchers rotated in shifts and used aspirators and torches to catch mosquitoes which landed on exposed limbs. Each hourly catch was placed into a prelabelled polystyrene container and taken to the laboratory at Kilifi for assessment.\n\nLaboratory procedures. Mosquito species were identified morphologically and scored as unfed, blood-fed or gravid. A proportion of An.gambiae s.l. females collected by both PSC and all-night biting catches were identified to sibling species by the method of polymerase chain reaction, PCR (Paskewitz & Collins, 1990). Primers used were specific for An.gambiae s.s., An.arabiensis and An.merus, members of the An.gambiae complex found at the Kenyan coast (Mosha & Petrarca, 1983). Samples of An.gambiae s.l. collected on human bait were dissected for parity determination as described by Detinova (1962). Mosquitoes collected by PSC were prepared for sporozoite enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing using monoclonal antibodies to detect circumsporozoite proteins of P.falciparum (Wirtz et al., 1987). Tests were assessed visually for positivity (Beier & Koros, 1991). Bloodmeals were identified by direct ELISA using anti-host (IgG) conjugates against human, cow and goat (Beier et al., 1988).\n\nBioassay, bioavailability and susceptibility tests. Nets were randomly selected from intervention households, between 1 and 17 months after they were issued. These nets were visually inspected and coded as either clean or dirty, and for the number of re-impregnations each net had received. Bioassay cones (W.H.O., 1975) were attached to the nets by means of elastic bands whilst the nets were hung upright in the laboratory. Two cones were used, one placed at the top of the net and the other on the lower portion toward the floor. Twenty laboratory-colonized female An. gambiae s.s. were introduced to each cone and exposed to the netting for 3 min before they were removed to paper cups. Delayed mortality was recorded after the mosquitoes had been left in the paper cups for 24 h with adequate sugar water in an ambient temperature of 25°C and a relative humidity of 72%. Four repeats per net were performed. Identical procedures were followed for untreated nets to serve as controls. Mortality was corrected for control mortality where the latter exceeded 20% of exposed mosquitoes.\n\nSample swatches of netting fabric were collected for highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) immediately after nets were impregnated for the first time and 11 months later, after two re-impregnations. HPLC assays were conducted at the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, U.S.A., to determine the concentration of the active cis isomer of permethrin per m<sup>2</sup> of netting.\n\nSusceptibility of wild-caught female mosquitoes, collected from an area adjacent to the study area, was determined in February 1995 using the W.H.O. (1981) test kit and procedure. Unfed An. gambiae s.l. females ( $n = 415$ ) were exposed to 0.25% permethrin test paper for 1 h. Delayed mortality was measured 24 h post-exposure to the permethrin or control papers, and corrected if control mortality exceeded 20%.\n\nStatistical analysis. The mean number of mosquitoes per house was calculated (from PSC data) for each of the zones sampled over the 12 months of surveillance (Table 1). The annual means of the thirty-three intervention zones were compared with the annual means of the thirty control zones using a Mann-Whitney U test (given their non-normal distribution). Human blood indices, sporozoite rates, parity and man-biting rates were analysed post-intervention using a Chi-square test, or controlling for pre-intervention rates using a Mantel Haenzel Chi-square test.\n\n## **Results**\n\nA total of 762 houses were sampled by PSC between May 1994 and April 1995. Of the 362 houses sampled within the nonintervention (control) area, 31.5% (114) yielded at least one An.gambiae s.l. or An.funestus, compared to only 11.3% (45/\n\n400) of the intervention houses sampled during the same period  $(\\chi^2 = 45.9, v = 1, P < 0.001)$ . As described previously (Mbogo et al., 1995), large between-zone variation in vector abundance occurs within this relatively small geographical area (Table 1). Comparing the ranks of the mean zonal densities of either An.gambiae s.l. or An.funestus per house indicates, before intervention, a significant difference of indoor-resting mosquito densities between intervention and non-intervention areas (Mann-Whitney U test,  $P < 0.0001$ ). Overall, post-intervention, there was a nine-fold reduction of the indoor-resting densities of both An.gambiae s.l. and An.funestus associated with ITBN use. Fig. 1 shows that the typical peaks of An.gambiae s.l. density during the long rains (May-August) and the short rains (November-December) were virtually eliminated in areas where ITBN were used.\n\nComposition of the An. gambiae complex differed significantly between non-intervention (control) and ITBN intervention areas (Table 2). Proportions of An.arabiensis, An.gambiae s.s. and An.merus were 7%, 49% and 44% respectively among seventytwo specimens identified by PCR from the intervention area. compared with 11%, 83% and 6% of these three sibling species, respectively, among 165 specimens identified from the nonintervention area. PSC densities of all three species were significantly different both between treatment areas and between species within areas (Table 2). Per house sampled, the intervention area had 2.9-fold more An.merus but 4-fold less An.arabiensis and 4.3-fold less An.gambiae s.s. than the non-intervention (control) area.\n\nIn houses with impregnated bednets, significantly fewer An.gambiae s.l. were found to be blood-fed and their humanblood index was lower than in control houses, although this difference was not statistically significant (Table 3). There were no significant differences between areas in the proportion of An.gambiae s.l. with detectable P.falciparum CS protein and\n\n![](_page_2_Figure_10.jpeg)\n\nFig. 1.

Biting cycle (hourly percentage on human bait) of An gambiae s.l. in houses where ITBN were used (light bars) and in a non-intervention zone where bednets were not used (dark bars).\n\n(deleterious or beneficial effects) entering houses in the control (non-intervention) area close to the intervention area, we used longitude and latitude to establish precise distances from intervention zones of thirty-five houses in control zones 57, 58 and 59, selected because they generated the largest numbers of mosquitoes. Distances were classified as more or less than 400 m from the intervention area. Among eleven households within 400 m, 9% had at least one mosquito, significantly less than 46% of twenty-four households at a distance of more than 400 m from the intervention area. ( $\\chi^2 = 4.5$ ,  $v = 1$ ,  $P < 0.05$ ).\n\nDetails of user compliance of the intervention will be presented elsewhere (Some et al., in prep.). Potency of the permethrin applied to bednets remained high throughout the trial. HPLC analyses of the nets indicated that, following the first treatment, the average concentration of cis-permethrin was  $0.43$  g/m<sup>2</sup> (95% CL 0.34-0.52) on thirty-six nets. Eleven months later, following re-impregnation after 6 months, the average concentration on thirty-six nets was 1.36 g/m<sup>2</sup> (95% CL 1.21-1.51).\n\nTable 4.

(1975) test kits, gave a mortality-rate of 94.5% when tests were undertaken 21 months after the trial began.\n\nBioassay tests with An.gambiae s.l. (3 min exposure, 24 h mortality) on various nets that had been used for up to 8 months following their initial impregnation in July 1993 gave greater than 78% kill (Table 4). Nets re-impregnated in April and November 1994 showed an increased killing capacity of 96-99.8%. Interestingly, nets which were found to be dirty with cooking soot had higher killing effects (94.1%) than nets which were clean  $(84.5\\%)$ .\n\n#### **Discussion**\n\nOur results demonstrate that permethrin-impregnated bednets exert a major impact upon the indoor-resting abundance of the principal vectors of *P.falciparum* malaria in coastal villages of Kenya. Indoor-resting densities of An.gambiae s.l. and An funestus were 9 times lower in houses where ITBN were in use, compared to households where no nets were used. This had the additional effect of eliminating the typical seasonal peaks in vector density usually seen in this part of Kenya (Fig. 1), despite evidence that more of the vector species were biting outdoors (Table 3). These findings are consistent with other studies of synthetic pyrethroid treated bednets or curtains in Africa (Lines et al., 1987; Majori et al., 1987; Lindsay et al., 1989, 1993; Magesa et al., 1991; Robert & Carnevale, 1991; Beach et al., 1993). The precise effect in each of these areas is difficult\n\nto compare, given the inherent differences in the sampling procedures used within each study. We opted not to use light traps (Lines et al., 1991; Mbogo et al., 1993a) in our estimation of vector abundance, because they tend to be less efficient in areas of low vector abundance (such as our study area) and have been shown to over-estimate parity rates in this area of Kenya (Petrarca et al., 1991). Furthermore, we required a simple and rapid means of monitoring endophilic mosquitoes over a wide geographical area, so as to truly reflect the impact of ITBN within our entire study population. Intensive entomological surveillance limited to a few sites – as suggested by the W.H.O.  $(1991)$  – can yield unrepresentative results in areas where marked overdispersion of vectors is common. However, it could be argued that reductions of indoor-resting densities - as determined by PSC - may simply reflect increased excito-repellency of the insecticides and not a reduction in the numbers of vectors coming to feed. Indeed, studies with exit traps in The Gambia have shown an increased rate of exophily due to ITBNs indoors (Snow et al., 1987; Miller et al., 1991). In addition, however, there is clear evidence that houses with pyrethroid-treated fabrics tend to significantly deter entry of vectors into the house (Lines et al., 1987; Lindsay et al., 1991). Further evidence from our study that man-vector contact was reduced is shown by the very highly significantly reduced proportion of An. gambiae s.l. found bloodfed in the early-morning PSC samples (Table 3). Human bait catches, however, revealed no significant reduction in the number of sporozoite inoculations an unprotected individual is likely to receive per year when living in a household where ITBN were used, compared to living in a house where no nets were in use. Whereas the sporozoite inoculation rate increased by 94% in the non-intervention area, for unaccountable (probably climatic) reasons between pre- and post-intervention years, it decreased by 8.3% in the ITBN intervention area, a significant reduction.\n\nInterestingly, our study did not demonstrate a significant reduction in the actual sporozoite rate or parity (an index of longevity) among vectors sampled from ITBN intervention zones compared to non-intervention (control) zones. Similar results were obtained in the Gambia, where bednets were also impregnated with permethrin  $0.5$  g/m<sup>2</sup>, and this has been interpreted as a probable lack of any so called 'mass effect' upon the vector population (Lindsay et al., 1993; Thomson et al., 1995). Mass effects would be difficult to prove in most field study designs, because the intervention could affect mosquito abundance in the untreated (control) as well as treated (ITBN) areas, as shown by the overall reductions compared to pre-intervention data in both The Gambia (Lindsay et al., 1993) and Burkina Faso (Robert & Carnevale, 1991). Hence Lines et al. (1987) and Lindsay et al. (1991) argued that, although individuals appear to be protected by ITBN against the bites of vector mosquitoes, there is no evidence that this increases the biting rate on unprotected neighbours. Under fortuitous circumstances, there may be some reduction of biting on people without ITBN if they are sufficiently closely associated with ITBN users to be afforded some protection. We have tried to assess this 'community protection' by studying three control communities in close proximity to intervention communities, comparing vector abundance by distance from the nearest houses where ITBN were widely employed. This analysis indicated that, within the non-intervention area, fewer houses closest to the intervention area had any malaria\n\nvectors compared to those further away.\n\nThe dipping procedures used for bednet impregnation during this trial provided adequate target treatment concentration of  $0.5$  g/m<sup>2</sup> (over 76% of all netting samples tested had excess of this figure), giving bioassay mortalities in excess of 80% throughout the study, increasing to almost 100% following multiple re-impregnations at half-yearly intervals (Table 4).\n\nPerhaps the greatest concern raised by this study is the observation that a significant proportion of malaria vectors appeared to bite earlier in the evening in houses where ITBN were used, with a greater tendency toward exophagy rather than the typical endophagy of most anthropophilic An gambiae.s.l. Furthermore, there was an apparent shift in sibling species composition of the An gambiae complex following the intro-duction of ITBN. Both An.merus and An.arabiensis have slightly different biting cycles to An. gambiae s.s. (Ivengar, 1962; White, 1974; Mosha & Petrarca, 1983). Earlier biting is associated with use of permethrin-treated bednets in Papua New Guinea (Charlwood & Graves, 1987). As the biting cycle change occurred immediately after installation of ITBNs in our study, in conjunction with the lack of evidence for a mass-killing effect, we conclude that the earlier biting reflects either an immediate intraspecific behavioural effect or a change in vector species proportions within the An.gambiae complex, and was not the result of selection for evolved behavioural resistance. Among our Kenyan study population, people usually 'go to bed' at 21.00-22.00 hours (unpublished data) and most children retire earlier, so their customs limit the opportunities for vectors to bite them, especially when they sleep under bednets. If ITBN are increasingly to be employed against malaria in tropical Africa, their effects on mosquito behaviour and insecticide susceptibility (cf. Vulule et al., 1996) should be monitored.\n\n#### **Acknowledgments**\n\nThis study was supported by funds from the UNDP/World Bank/ W.H.O.
