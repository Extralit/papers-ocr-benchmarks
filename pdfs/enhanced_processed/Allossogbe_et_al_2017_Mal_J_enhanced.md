These nets are treated with the\npiperonyl butoxide (PBO) synergist which inhibit the action of detoxification enzymes. The effectiveness of the\nnew-generation nets has been proven in some studies, but their specific effect on mosquitoes carrying detoxification enzymes and those carrying both detoxification enzymes and the knock-down resistance gene in Benin is not\nwell known. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of LLINs treated with PBO on multi-resistant\nAnopheles gambiae s.l.\n\n**Methods:** The study occurred in seven cities in Benin, Abomey, Cotonou, Porto-Novo, Zangnanado, Parakou, Malanville and Tanguiéta, and included ten locations selected on a north–south transect. Mosquito larvae were collected\nfrom these sites, and adult females from these larvae were exposed to single-pyrethroid-treated nets (LifeNet, PermaNet 2.0, Olyset Net) and bi-treated nets (PermaNet 3.0 and Olyset Plus) based on their level of resistance and using\nWHO cone tests following WHO guidelines.\n\n**Results:** The different LLINs showed 100% mortality of the susceptible laboratory strain Kisumu and the resistant strain Ace-1R Kisumu. However, with the resistant laboratory strain kdr-Kisumu, mortality was low (16–32%) for\nall LLINs except PermaNet 3.0 (82.9%). The mortality of local strains carrying only the kdr mechanism varied from 0\nto 47% for the single-pyrethroid-treated LLINs and 9 to 86% for bi-treated LLINs. With local strains carrying several\nmechanisms of resistance (kdr + detoxification enzymes), the observed mortality with different LLINs was also low\nexcept for PermaNet 3.0, which induced significantly higher mortality, usually greater than 75% (p < 0.001), with multiresistant strains. The inhibition of the mortalities induced by the LLINs (11–96%) on multi-resistant field populations\nwas similar to the inhibition observed with the laboratory strain carrying only the knock-down resistance mechanism\n(kdr-Kisumu) (p > 0.05).\n\n**Conclusion:** This study showed that the new-generation LLINs treated with pyrethroids and PBO showed better\nefficacy compared to conventional LLINs. Although the addition of PBO significantly increased the mortality of mosquitoes, the significant role of the kdr resistance gene in the low efficacy of LLINs calls for LLIN technology innovation\nthat specifically targets this mechanism.\n\n**Keywords:** LLINs, Bio-efficacy, Piperonyl butoxide, Resistant mosquitoes\n\n\n*Correspondence: palutec@yahoo.fr\n1 Centre de Recherche Entomologique de Cotonou (CREC), Cotonou,\nBenin\n\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\n\n© The Author(s) 2017.

Malar J (2017) 16:77 Page 2 of 11\n\n\n\n**Background**\nMalaria is a major public health problem worldwide,\nand particularly so in Benin. It remains a permanent\nthreat from its high morbidity (214 million) and mortality (438,000). Africa is the most endemic region\naffected (395,000 deaths per year) [1]. It affects onefifth of the world population. However, this proportion\nhas decreased significantly by 37% between 2000 and\n2015 due to the effect of malaria prevention and treatment methods, including long-lasting insecticidal nets\n(LLINs), indoor residual spraying of residual insecticides\n(IRS), chemo-prevention for pregnant women and children, and therapeutic treatment with artemisinin-based\ncombinations.\n\nAmong these prevention methods, LLINs have\nemerged in recent years as a privileged tool to prevent\nmalaria. Te insecticides selected by the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) for LLIN treatment are pyrethroids, which have little toxicity to humans, are effective at low doses, are fast acting (knock-down effect)\nand, along with repellants, have an irritant effect [2]. Te\nAbuja Conference, which brought together all the leaders\nof Africa and other UN representative states, donors and\nNGOs in April 2000, gave impetus to a political commitment to the fight against malaria with the use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) [3]. Efforts are being made to\nincrease accessibility for populations, especially pregnant\nwomen and children under five, who are vulnerable to\nmalaria, a major cause of perinatal mortality, low birth\nweight and maternal anaemia [1].\nSeveral research studies have been conducted and\nhave shown the effectiveness of ITNs in the fight against\nmalaria in Burkina Faso [4], Cameroon [5], Gambia [6–\n9], the Democratic Republic of Congo [10], Kenya [11],\nGhana [12], Benin [13] and Côte d’Ivoire [14].\nHowever, several studies have shown that Anopheles\ngambiae s.l. has developed strong resistance to pyrethroids and DDT in Benin, with a very high knock-down\nresistance frequency of approximately 80% in the urban\nareas of Cotonou and in rural areas [15–23].\nDespite this resistance developed by An. gambiae s.l. to\npyrethroids, LLINs remain effective in vector resistance\nareas [24] and provide protection through their mechanical barrier role [25]. However, Asidi et al. [26] showed a\ndecrease in their effectiveness in areas of high resistance\nof Anopheles in southern Benin. Major developed resistance mechanisms are the targets of modification (kdr\nresistance and ace-1R) and metabolic resistance (overexpression of detoxification enzymes, oxidases, esterases,\nGST) [27]. Te kdr mutation is associated with pyrethroid and DDT resistance, and ace-1R is associated with\norganophosphate and carbamate resistance (two classes\nof insecticides which are not used to treat LLINs) [15, 28].\n\n\n\nTo increase the effectiveness of ITNs in areas of high\nresistance, new nets treated with a so-called new-generation of chemicals has been developed. Tey are treated\nwith a synergist called piperonyl butoxide (PBO). For\nsome LLINs, the PBO is used on all sides of the net\n(Olyset Plus [®] ). For others, only the upper part of the\nnet is processed (PermaNet [®] 3.0). Te principle of an\nITN synergist is to inhibit the action of detoxification\nenzymes, which will result in increasing the effectiveness of the insecticide against resistant populations of\nmosquitoes.\nEvidence of the efficacy of PermaNet 3.0 has been\nshown in some studies, particularly in Tanzania [29],\nbut we do not know its specific action on mosquitoes\ncarrying detoxification enzymes and on those carrying\nboth detoxification and kdr mechanisms in West Africa,\nparticularly in Benin. Tere have been limited data on\nthe bio-efficacy of new-generation LLINs against multiresistant mosquitoes in Africa in general and particularly\nin Benin. Tus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs)\ntreated with PBO on multi-resistant An. gambiae s.l.\npopulations in Benin. It aims to assess the bio-efficacy\nof LLINs in areas with a high frequency of molecular\nresistance genes (kdr and ace-1R) and over-expression of\ndetoxification enzymes (oxidases, esterases, GST). Te\nefficacy of the new-generation LLINs against pyrethroidresistant Anopheles was also compared to that of conventional LLINs.\n\n\n**Methods**\n\n**Study design**\nTis study is transversal and compares variability of the\nefficacy of two different types of LLINs against An. gambiae s.l. carrying kdr resistance mutations and detoxification enzymes in Benin. Te two types of LLINs included\nconventional LLINs only treated with pyrethroids (Olyset\nNet, LifeNet, and PermaNet 2.0) and a second type of\nnew-generation LLIN treated with pyrethroids and\npiperonyl butoxide (PBO), which inhibits the action of\nenzymes, particularly oxidases.\nTe study was conducted in Benin, a West African\ncountry from June 2015 to March 2016. Among the 12\ndepartments of Benin surveyed, seven were selected in\nthis study (Atlantique, Littoral, Oueme, Zou, Borgou,\nAtacora and Alibori). Priority was given to areas where\nhigher oxidase activity was observed compared to the\nsusceptible strain An. gambiae Kisumu. Tey were represented by Abomey, Cotonou, Porto-Novo, Zangnanado, Parakou, Malanville and Tanguiéta districts. Te\nassessment of oxidase activity was conducted on 50 An.\ngambiae s.l. collected from each district using haem-peroxidase assay as described by Brogdon et al. [30].\n\n\n', 'words': []}, {'metadata': {'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'WHO cone bio-assays of classical and new-generation long-lasting insecticidal nets call for innovative insecticides targeting the knock-down resistance mechanism in Benin', 'author': 'Marius Allossogbe', 'subject': 'Malaria Journal, doi:10.1186/s12936-017-1727-x', 'keywords': 'LLINs,Bio-efficacy,Piperonyl butoxide,Resistant mosquitoes', 'creator': 'ocrmypdf 16.1.2 / Tesseract OCRhOCR 5.3.4', 'producer': 'pikepdf 8.13.0', 'creationDate': "D:20170214204129+05'30'", 'modDate': "D:20240423063541+00'00'", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': None, 'file_path': 'pdfs/Allossogbe_et_al_2017_Mal_J.pdf', 'page_count': 11, 'page': 3}, 'toc_items': [[3, 'Study sites', 3], [4, 'Malanville', 3], [4, 'Tanguieta', 3], [4, 'Abomey-Calavi', 3], [4, 'Cotonou', 3], [4, 'Porto-Novo', 3], [4, 'Parakou', 3], [4, 'Zangnanado', 3], [3, 'Larvae collection', 3], [3, 'Highlighting resistance mechanisms', 3], [3, 'Mosquito nets', 3]], 'tables': [], 'images': [], 'graphics': [], 'text': 'Allossogbe et al.

Malar J (2017) 16:77 Page 4 of 11\n\n\n\n**Cone test**\n\nTe cone test is used to assess the effectiveness of an\ninsecticide and its persistence on the net. It was conducted following the WHO protocol. Tis test aims to\ncompare the behaviour of mosquitoes while in contact\nwith treated mosquito nets without PBO or with PBO.\nCone tests were performed on five types of nets (Olyset\nPlus, Olyset Net, LifeNet, PermaNet 2.0 and PermaNet\n3.0). Tese tests were carried out using fragments of\nLLINs (30 cm × 30 cm) cut from five (05) positions on\neach net. Two standard cones were fixed with a plastic\nsheet on each of the five (05) screen fragments. For PermaNet 3.0 LLIN, an additional two cones were added on\nthe PBO-containing roof. Five unfed An. gambiae females\naged 2–5 days (Kisumu or wild type) were introduced\ninto each cone placed on the LLIN for 3 min. After exposure, the mosquitoes were removed from the cones using\na mouth aspirator and then transferred into paper cups\nand provided 10% sugar solution. Mosquito knock-down\nwas recorded every 5 min for 60 min. A negative control\n(untreated net) was included in each series of cone tests.\nAfter 24 h of observation, mortality post exposure was\nrecorded. No correction of mortality with Abbott’s formula was used as mortality in the control was <5%. All\nthese operations were carried out at a temperature of\n25 ± 2 °C and a humidity of 70 ± 10%.\n\n\n**Data analysis**\nAccording to the WHO, the bio-effectiveness threshold is\n95% knock-down and 80% mortality for laboratory mosquitoes; but for resistant field mosquito populations, we\nused a threshold of 70% knock-down and 50% mortality. Terefore, all nets showing less than 95% knockdown\nfor laboratory mosquitoes and 70% for field mosquitoes\nafter 60 min, or less than 50% mortality for laboratory\nmosquitoes and 50% for field mosquitoes after 24 h of\nobservation, were considered ineffective. Tese knockdown thresholds were chosen taking into account the\nkdr resistance level observed in the country in general\n(>50%).\nTe inhibition of mortality induced by resistance\nmechanisms was estimated using the following equation:\n\n\nInhibition = 1 − (p1 / p2) × 100\n\n\n=\nwhere p1 proportion of resistant mosquitoes dead and\np2 = proportion of susceptible Kisumu mosquitoes dead.\nTo determine if there was any significance difference\nbetween the outcome variables (knock-down, mortality\nand inhibition), Poisson regression (for numeric data)\nand logistic regression (for proportional data) were used.\nTe 50 and 95% knock-down times and their confidence\nintervals were obtained after log-probit regression using\nthe method described by Finney [33].\n\n\n\n**Results**\n\n**Characteristics of the studied mosquito populations**\nTe majority of female mosquitoes were collected and\nidentified morphologically as An. gambiae s.l. Te biochemical and molecular analyses indicated that among\nten sites, five showed significantly higher oxidase activity than the susceptible strain Kisumu (Table 1). Esterases\nwere significantly expressed in the Tanguieta mosquito\npopulation (Table 1). Over-expression of glutathioneS-transferase was observed at four sites (Table 1). However, the allelic frequency of the kdr mutation was high at\nalmost all sites and ranged from 0.03 to 0.93.\n\n\n**Knock-down (KD) and mortality of laboratory strains**\nFigure 2 shows the proportion of laboratory mosquitoes\n(ace-1R-Kisumu, kdr-Kisumu, and susceptible Kisumu)\nknocked down after 60 min for each LLIN. Te Olyset\nPlus and PermaNet 3.0 LLINs induced 100% knock-down\nof An. gambiae Kisumu. Te knock-down effect was\n96.15% for Olyset, 90.2% for LifeNet and 93.22% for PermaNet 2.0.\n\nWith the ace-1R-Kisumu strain, which carries the acetylcholinesterase-1 resistance gene, there was a knockdown effect greater than 95% for all nets, with 98.11% for\nLifeNet, 100% for Olyset, 98.18% for Olyset Plus, 97.96%\nfor PermaNet 2.0, and 98.78% for PermaNet 3.0 (Fig. 2).\nFor the kdr-Kisumu strain (carrying the resistance\nknock-down), the knock-down effects observed were\n89.29% for LifeNet, 63.64 for Olyset Net, 71.43% for\nOlyset Plus, 45.78 for PermaNet 2.0 and 71.05% for PermaNet 3.0 (Fig. 2).\nKisumu and ace-1R-Kisumu (Fig. 3). With the kdrKisumu strain, mortality was 16% for Olyset Net, 26% for\nPermaNet 2.0, 28% for LifeNet, and 32.1% for Olyset Plus\nbut was more than 82.9% for PermaNet 3.0.

Generally, there\nwas a slower effect with LLINs treated with permethrin\n(Table 4).\n\n\n**Discussion**\n\nTis study is one of the first conducted in Benin to compare the response of local malaria vectors in Benin to\nseveral LLINs recommended by the WHO. It helps to\nobserve the variation in mortality of vectors submitted\nto different types of LLINs. Tis mortality was generally\nlow, especially with LLINs only treated with pyrethroids.\n\n\n', 'words': []}, {'metadata': {'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'WHO cone bio-assays of classical and new-generation long-lasting insecticidal nets call for innovative insecticides targeting the knock-down resistance mechanism in Benin', 'author': 'Marius Allossogbe', 'subject': 'Malaria Journal, doi:10.1186/s12936-017-1727-x', 'keywords': 'LLINs,Bio-efficacy,Piperonyl butoxide,Resistant mosquitoes', 'creator': 'ocrmypdf 16.1.2 / Tesseract OCRhOCR 5.3.4', 'producer': 'pikepdf 8.13.0', 'creationDate': "D:20170214204129+05'30'", 'modDate': "D:20240423063541+00'00'", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': None, 'file_path': 'pdfs/Allossogbe_et_al_2017_Mal_J.pdf', 'page_count': 11, 'page': 8}, 'toc_items': [], 'tables': [], 'images': [], 'graphics': [], 'text': 'Allossogbe et al.

In a\nrecent study conducted in Benin [36], Olyset Plus, treated\nwith permethrin + PBO, demonstrated a higher efficacy\nthan Olyset Net against wild multi-resistant An. gambiae\ns.l. in experimental huts, as observed in WHO cone tests\nused in the present study. In south-western Ethiopia [35]\nand in Uganda [34], a reduced efficacy of mono-treated\nLLINs was also observed against wild resistant An. gambiae s.l. in comparison with Permanet 3.0 treated with\ndeltamethrin + PBO. Te results are similar to those\nobserved in this study. However, these studies did not\ninclude Olyset Plus, the second type of new-generation\nLLINs treated with permethrin + PBO.\nTe reduced efficacy of LLINs treated with permethrin\nwould be related to the strong resistance of the local vectors to permethrin due to the resistance selection pressures generated by the use of the same class of insecticide\nfor malaria vector control in public health and for pest\ncontrol in agriculture [16, 17, 23, 37, 38].\nTe comparison of LLIN bio-efficacy performed in this\nstudy provides the necessary information for the selection of appropriate LLINs for mass distribution. Te optimal and constant efficacy of PermaNet 3.0 LLINs on all\nvector populations shows that this combination of deltamethrin and PBO on LLINs is a most successful strat\negy against pyrethroid resistance in Benin. Variations in\nthe mortality of vectors also showed that certain types\nof LLINs are more appropriate than others for distribution in specific regions. Tis is related to the fact that\nthe effectiveness of an LLIN depends on the characteristics of the mosquito population tested and the chemical\nstructure of the molecule (insecticide) used.\nTe mosquito populations assessed in the present study\nwere characterized by a high frequency of the kdr gene.\nTis high frequency was probably due to the massive use\nof pyrethroids in agriculture and public health. In some\nareas, such as Tanguieta, Parakou, Houeyiho, Akron,\nand Ladji, farmers and gardeners use huge amounts of\ninsecticides to reduce pests in their crops, which explains\nthe presence and strong expression of several resistance\nmechanisms in the mosquito populations [39, 40]. Overproduction of resistance enzymes in these areas would be\nlinked to pressure on mosquito larvae from insecticides\nused by farmers to protect vegetable crops [41–43]. Tis\nexpression of the kdr resistance gene induced a 17–84%\nreduction in LLIN efficacy against laboratory strains.\nTese frequencies are similar to those observed in natural populations of An. gambiae s.l. Tis observation\nshows that the kdr gene is the main mechanism involved\nin the reduction of the effectiveness of LLINs. Although\ndetoxification enzymes contribute to resistance, their\nimpact is successfully inhibited by the presence of PBO\non new-generation LLINs and the remaining part is more\n\n\n\nlikely related to the presence of kdr gene in the mosquito\npopulations. Tis also suggests that the search for new\nmolecules or combinations of molecules that target the\nkdr resistance mechanism should be promoted.\nTe WHO recommends preventive measures against\nvector resistance to insecticides [44]. Te results of this\nstudy therefore constitute important evidence that can\nguide decision making in the selection and distribution of\nhigh efficacy LLINs in specific regions of Benin. Te use\nof LLINs that showed high bio-efficacy against the local\nvector populations should be encouraged to contribute\nsubstantively to reducing the transmission of malaria in\nBenin.\n\nTis study also suggests the need to develop a routine\nfor monitoring the bio-efficacy of LLINs against local\nmalaria vectors for the replacement of ineffective LLINs.\nHowever, community studies would be needed to evaluate the epidemiological impact of these LLINs to confirm\nwhether or not the low efficacy observed is followed by a\nloss of the epidemiological impact of these nets.\nAlthough the important results of this study, it had\ncertain limitations. Strong evaluation would have been\npossible if tunnel tests were conducted on LLINs that\ndid not meet the criteria of 80% mortality with resistant mosquito strains. In addition, a chemical analysis of\nthe LLINs prior to the start of the study would also have\nimproved the quality of the results. However, all the\nLLINs demonstrated a good performance with susceptible laboratory stain Kisumu (mortality > 80%), as recommended by WHO [45], and the focus of this study was\nto demonstrate the important role of resistance mechanisms on LLINs efficacy.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTis study showed variable effectiveness of LLINs on An.\ngambiae s.l. populations from different localities surveyed\nfrom north to south in Benin. Te new-generation LLINs\nwith pyrethroids and PBO (PermaNet 3.0 and Olyset Plus)\nshowed higher efficacy than conventional LLINs (PermaNet 2.0, LifeNet and Olyset net). However, the strong\nresistance of local vectors to permethrin suggests that the\ncombination of deltamethrin + PBO is the most appropriate strategy against local vectors in Benin. Although the\naddition of PBO (targeting many biochemical mechanisms\nof resistance) significantly increased the mortality of mosquitoes, the significantly high role of the kdr resistance\ngene in the low efficacy of LLINs calls for LLIN technology\ninnovation that specifically targets this mechanism.\n\n\n**Authors’ contributions**\n\nMA, VG and MCA designed the study, supervised laboratory work, analyzed\ndata and wrote the manuscript.
