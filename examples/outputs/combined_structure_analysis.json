There was no difference in the frequency of kdr alleles between live and dead collections from any of the treatments (P.0.05) (Tables 6). Analysis of genotype frequency (Table 7) showed that survival of the kdr heterozygotes (47% was no different from that of kdr homogygotes for resistance (52%) in the presence of LLIN (1st trial: P = 0.71, 2nd trial: P = 0.54).",
            "While the ace-1R was low, there was generally a greater tendency for mosquitoes bearing the ace-1<sup>R</sup> allele to survive in huts with the p-methyl treatments alone in the single intervention trial. The ace-1R allele frequency was significantly higher in mosquitoes which survived in huts in which p-methyl treated DL and NWH were applied alone on walls and ceiling (P#0.03) (Table 6). Analysis of genotype frequency showed that 100% (9/9) of ace-1R heterozygotes survived the p-methyl treatments but only 32% (105/323) of ace-1 susceptibles survived (P = 0.001), indicating strong selection for the ace-1<sup>R</sup> resistance with the p-methyl interventions. In the second trial, all mosquitoes which entered the huts with p-methyl treatments whether applied alone or in combination with LLINs were killed (100% mortality). It was thus not possible to clearly demonstrate whether the combination prevents selection of the ace-1<sup>R</sup> gene compared to the single intervention of p-methyl (Tables 6 and 7). The low survival of kdr with the combination indicates that the p-methyl component might prevent the further selection of kdr resistance (Table 7).",

            "- 1. Single intervention trial: A total of 3933 An gambiae ss were collected from the experimental huts during the trial. The results obtained are presented in Table 3 and Figure 1. Bloodfeeding rates were generally high (70–83%) with the DL and NWH alone (Figure 1) since mosquitoes would normally feed on the person sleeping in the hut before resting on the wall. Hence the treatments provided limited blood-feeding inhibition (4–20%) and personal protection (29–56%) (Table 3). Mortality with pyrethroid DL was 40% (Figure 1). P-methyl treated DL and NWH induced much higher mortality rates (.95%) than pyrethroid DL (P,0.001). With only walls covered, p-methyl DL and NWH showed a similar performance. Highest mortality was attained when all hut surfaces (walls and ceiling) were covered with p-methyl NWH (99%) and hence for the follow on trials, the p-methyl DL and NWH treatments tested were applied on walls and ceiling.",
            "- 2. First combined intervention trial: A total of 320 An gambiae ss were collected from the experimental huts during the second trial, far fewer than in the first trial. By this time, the rice in the fields had grown significantly and covered the breeding sites leading to lower numbers of mosquitoes entering the huts compared to the first trial. The results obtained in this trial are presented in Table 4 and Figure 2. The holed LLIN was more protective (23% bloodfed and 0% found inside the net) than the untreated holed net (81% bloodfed and 36% found inside the net) (Table 4 and Figure 2). Combining pmethyl DL and NWH with LLINs reduced bloodfeeding rates significantly (8–9% bloodfed) compared to p-methyl DL and NWH alone (Figure 2) (P,0.001). The combination therefore provided more bloodfeeding inhibition (90–91%) and personal protection (94–95%) than the p-methyl treatments alone (50% bloodfeeding inhibition and 51–70% personal protection) (Table 4). Mortality with the LLIN alone was 60% (Figure 2). Mortality was 100% when p-methyl DL and NWH where used whether alone or in combination with LLINs.",
            "- 3. Second combined intervention trial: The results are presented in Table 5 and Figure 3. A total of 490 An gambiae ss were collected from the experimental huts during this trial (Table 5). Combining LLINs with pyrethroid DL did not show any improvement in mortality (48%) compared to the LLIN alone (44%) and pyrethroid DL alone (40%) (P.0.1) (Figure 3). Mortality was much higher (95%) when p-methyl DL was combined with LLINs.",

The results obtained are presented in Table 3 and Figure 1. Bloodfeeding rates were generally high (70–83%) with the DL and NWH alone (Figure 1) since mosquitoes would normally feed on the person sleeping in the hut before resting on the wall. Hence the treatments provided limited blood-feeding inhibition (4–20%) and personal protection (29–56%) (Table 3). Mortality with pyrethroid DL was 40% (Figure 1). P-methyl treated DL and NWH induced much higher mortality rates (.95%) than pyrethroid DL (P,0.001). With only walls covered, p-methyl DL and NWH showed a similar performance. Highest mortality was attained when all hut surfaces (walls and ceiling) were covered with p-methyl NWH (99%) and hence for the follow on trials, the p-methyl DL and NWH treatments tested were applied on walls and ceiling.",

By this time, the rice in the fields had grown significantly and covered the breeding sites leading to lower numbers of mosquitoes entering the huts compared to the first trial. The results obtained in this trial are presented in Table 4 and Figure 2. The holed LLIN was more protective (23% bloodfed and 0% found inside the net) than the untreated holed net (81% bloodfed and 36% found inside the net) (Table 4 and Figure 2). Combining pmethyl DL and NWH with LLINs reduced bloodfeeding rates significantly (8–9% bloodfed) compared to p-methyl DL and NWH alone (Figure 2) (P,0.001). The combination therefore provided more bloodfeeding inhibition (90–91%) and personal protection (94–95%) than the p-methyl treatments alone (50% bloodfeeding inhibition and 51–70% personal protection) (Table 4).

Analysis of genotype frequency showed that 100% (9/9) of ace-1R heterozygotes survived the p-methyl treatments but only 32% (105/323) of ace-1 susceptibles survived (P = 0.001), indicating strong selection for the ace-1<sup>R</sup> resistance with the p-methyl interventions. In the second trial, all mosquitoes which entered the huts with p-methyl treatments whether applied alone or in combination with LLINs were killed (100% mortality). It was thus not possible to clearly demonstrate whether the combination prevents selection of the ace-1<sup>R</sup> gene compared to the single intervention of p-methyl (Tables 6 and 7). The low survival of kdr with the combination indicates that the p-methyl component might prevent the further selection of kdr resistance (Table 7).",

                "e average time estimated for knock-down of 50% of resistant local An. gambiae s.l. populations was significantly shorter with PermaNet 3.0 (12 min) (p < 0.001), followed by Olyset Plus and LifeNet (33 min). However, the time required for 95% of mosquitoes to be knocked down was high for all LLINs. Generally, there was a slower effect with LLINs treated with permethrin (Table [4\\)](#page-7-1).",
                "is study is one of the first conducted in Benin to compare the response of local malaria vectors in Benin to several LLINs recommended by the WHO. It helps to observe the variation in mortality of vectors submitted to different types of LLINs. is mortality was generally low, especially with LLINs only treated with pyrethroids.",

                "Cone tests showed that LLINs treated with piperonyl butoxide and pyrethroids (especially PermaNet 3.0) have optimum efficacy on all strains of An. gambiae s.l. (mono and multi-resistant).",
                "Several studies have shown a decrease in the bio-efficacy of LLINs against local pyrethroid-resistant vectors [[34,](#page-9-24) [35](#page-10-0)]. e effectiveness of LLINs treated only with deltamethrin (PermaNet 2.0 and LifeNet) was found to be significantly lower compared to that of nets treated with deltamethrin and PBO. e same observation was made with the LLINs treated with permethrin only (Olyset Net) and those treated with permethrin and PBO. However, the effectiveness of LLINs treated with permethrin was generally lower than that of LLINs treated with deltamethrin, with lower mortality and a very slow knock-down time (KDT 50 and 95%) compared to other LLINs. In a recent study conducted in Benin [[36\\]](#page-10-1), Olyset Plus, treated with permethrin + PBO, demonstrated a higher efficacy than Olyset Net against wild multi-resistant An. gambiae s.l. in experimental huts, as observed in WHO cone tests used in the present study. In south-western Ethiopia [[35](#page-10-0)] and in Uganda [\\[34\\]](#page-9-24), a reduced efficacy of mono-treated LLINs was also observed against wild resistant An. gambiae s.l. in comparison with Permanet 3.0 treated with deltamethrin + PBO. e results are similar to those observed in this study. However, these studies did not include Olyset Plus, the second type of new-generation LLINs treated with permethrin + PBO.",
                "e reduced efficacy of LLINs treated with permethrin would be related to the strong resistance of the local vectors to permethrin due to the resistance selection pressures generated by the use of the same class of insecticide for malaria vector control in public health and for pest control in agriculture [\\[16](#page-9-25), [17](#page-9-26), [23,](#page-9-13) [37](#page-10-2), [38\\]](#page-10-3).",
                "e comparison of LLIN bio-efficacy performed in this study provides the necessary information for the selection of appropriate LLINs for mass distribution. e optimal and constant efficacy of PermaNet 3.0 LLINs on all vector populations shows that this combination of deltamethrin and PBO on LLINs is a most successful strategy against pyrethroid resistance in Benin. Variations in the mortality of vectors also showed that certain types of LLINs are more appropriate than others for distribution in specific regions. is is related to the fact that the effectiveness of an LLIN depends on the characteristics of the mosquito population tested and the chemical structure of the molecule (insecticide) used.",
                "e mosquito populations assessed in the present study were characterized by a high frequency of the kdr gene. is high frequency was probably due to the massive use of pyrethroids in agriculture and public health. In some areas, such as Tanguieta, Parakou, Houeyiho, Akron, and Ladji, farmers and gardeners use huge amounts of insecticides to reduce pests in their crops, which explains the presence and strong expression of several resistance mechanisms in the mosquito populations [\\[39](#page-10-4), [40](#page-10-5)]. Overproduction of resistance enzymes in these areas would be linked to pressure on mosquito larvae from insecticides used by farmers to protect vegetable crops [\\[41](#page-10-6)–[43\\]](#page-10-7). is expression of the kdr resistance gene induced a 17–84% reduction in LLIN efficacy against laboratory strains. ese frequencies are similar to those observed in natural populations of An. gambiae s.l. is observation shows that the kdr gene is the main mechanism involved in the reduction of the effectiveness of LLINs. Although detoxification enzymes contribute to resistance, their impact is successfully inhibited by the presence of PBO on new-generation LLINs and the remaining part is more likely related to the presence of kdr gene in the mosquito populations. is also suggests that the search for new molecules or combinations of molecules that target the kdr resistance mechanism should be promoted.",
                "e WHO recommends preventive measures against vector resistance to insecticides [[44\\]](#page-10-8). e results of this study therefore constitute important evidence that can guide decision making in the selection and distribution of high efficacy LLINs in specific regions of Benin. e use of LLINs that showed high bio-efficacy against the local vector populations should be encouraged to contribute substantively to reducing the transmission of malaria in Benin.",
                "is study also suggests the need to develop a routine for monitoring the bio-efficacy of LLINs against local malaria vectors for the replacement of ineffective LLINs. However, community studies would be needed to evaluate the epidemiological impact of these LLINs to confirm whether or not the low efficacy observed is followed by a loss of the epidemiological impact of these nets.",
                "Although the important results of this study, it had certain limitations. Strong evaluation would have been possible if tunnel tests were conducted on LLINs that did not meet the criteria of 80% mortality with resistant mosquito strains. In addition, a chemical analysis of the LLINs prior to the start of the study would also have improved the quality of the results. However, all the LLINs demonstrated a good performance with susceptible laboratory stain Kisumu (mortality > 80%), as recommended by WHO [\\[45\\]](#page-10-9), and the focus of this study was to demonstrate the important role of resistance mechanisms on LLINs efficacy.",
                "is study showed variable effectiveness of LLINs on An. gambiae s.l. populations from different localities surveyed from north to south in Benin. e new-generation LLINs with pyrethroids and PBO (PermaNet 3.0 and Olyset Plus) showed higher efficacy than conventional LLINs (PermaNet 2.0, LifeNet and Olyset net). However, the strong resistance of local vectors to permethrin suggests that the combination of deltamethrin + PBO is the most appropriate strategy against local vectors in Benin. Although the addition of PBO (targeting many biochemical mechanisms of resistance) significantly increased the mortality of mosquitoes, the significantly high role of the kdr resistance gene in the low efficacy of LLINs calls for LLIN technology innovation that specifically targets this mechanism.",

(i) After a year of baseline data collection, lambdacyhalothrin-treated bed nets were introduced into 3 of 5 villages in north-west Thailand, the remaining 2 being treated with placebo. Human bait collections were carried out in each village on 2 nights per month, for 8 months of each year, and the biting densities were compared between the first year and the second year. The treated bed nets did not have any significant impact on the density or parous rates of Anopheles sawadwongporni and A. maculatus S.S. populations. The results for A. dirus s.1. were not conclusive because of the low number caught. Significant reductions in biting and parous rates of A. minimus species A were observed in only one of the 3 treated villages, and there was no overall difference between treated and control groups. However, the trial suffered from the washing of nets by villagers and the low rate of reimpregnation. (ii) A short-term study involved 4 villages in a cross-over design, and lasted 48 d. For the first 24 d, residents of 2 villages were given new treated nets while the other 2 villages retained their own untreated nets. For the second 24 d, this situation was reversed. Daily light-trapping revealed no significant difference in the indoor densities or parous rates of A. minimus species A between the periods with treated or untreated nets. Both studies, especially the second., suggested that the community-wide use of treated bed nets did not generally reduce the vectorial capacity of vectors in this area, probably because of the biting behaviour of the mosquitoes",

Mae Hong Son movince. north-west Thailand: adjacent to the Mianmar horde;. The province is extremely mountainous and forested, with very limited plains areas. Forest fringe villa es are typically situated in foothills surrounded by rice H dds, scrub and secondary forest, with streams running through or alongside them. Farm huts, the temporary shelters to which villagers move during ploughing and harvesting periods, are scattered in rice fields m the valleys and on the mountains. Some villages are situated deeper in the hills and in the forest. Cattle and pigs are common in most Karen settlements.",

Other routine anti-malaria activities continued.",
                "Study design. The study was divided into 2 phases, the first (baseline phase) during the high transmission season from May to December 1990 and the second (intervention phase) during the same months in 1991. In February/March 1991, bed nets in Mae Chon, Mae &lap and Huai Ngu were treated with lambdacyhalothrin (10 mg/m2) while those in Mae Han and Mae Top Nua were treated with placebo. The design permitted pre- and post-intervention comparisons in each village, and contemporary comparisons between treated and untreated villages.",

Mosquitoes were collected on 2 human baits indoors and 2 outdoors for 2 nights each month from May to December 1990 (before intervention1 and Mav to December 1991 (after intervention). The indoor collections were perfo&ed outside the sleeping room of villagers throughout the night, but the outdoor catches (5-10 m away) were made only until midnight. Similar collections were carried out simultaneously at the farm hut areas of each forest fringe village (located 2-3 km away). After morphological identification, the ovaries of mosquitoes were examined for parity (DETINOVA, 1962).",

Mae Top Klang is another Karen village separated from Mae Top Nua by about 500 m and 2 hills (see above), and was involved-in the previous epidemiolbgical study as a control (untreated) unit in 1990-1991.

                "Intervention method. House-to-house surveys were carried out one month before the intervention began. The purpose of the experiment was explained to the residents. Since Mae Top Nua and Mae Top Klang are close to each other, and there may have been some overlapping of their mosquito populations, they were treated in the same period. On 1 July 1992 new cotton-polyester bed nets treated individually with lambdacyhalothrin (10 mglm2) were distributed to everyone in Mae Top Nua and Mae To P Klang except the occupants of 3 sentinel rooms used or mosquito trapping. The bed nets of residents who already hid them tier; temporarily stored to ensure that thev used onlv the treated ones. On 25 Tulv 1992 the treated nets were replaced with the occup&t? own bed nets, which were untreated. In the other 2 communities, Mae Chon and the Wild Animal Conservation Centre, this pattern was reversed. At the end of the study all the treated bed nets were given free to the villagers. The villagers' bed nets were also treated as requested. In Mae Chon, where 36% of nets had been treated in late 1991 in the long-term study (about 6 months before this study began), people were encouraged to wash their nets before the study.",

                "were compared between 1990 (pre-intervention) and 1991 (post-intervention), for each species and village, a broadly similar pattern was seen in both densities and parous rates. The great majority of year-on-year comparisons showed no significant change, and there was no hint that densities and parous rates in treated villages were more likely to decrease, or less likely to increase, than in untreated villages. Presumably, therefore, the significant changes that were seen were due to environmental factors rather than the intervention.",
                "The fact that there was no apparent impact of the nets on populations of A. sawadwongpomi and A. maculatus S.S. is not surprising. These 2 species are largely exophagic and zoophilic (UPATHAM etal., 1988), and would not be expected to be greatly affected, at the population level, by the introduction of treated nets, even in conditions of high coverage. Neither was it very surprising that there was no consistent evidence for an effect of treated nets on any species in the farm hut setting. Although some villagers did take their treated nets with them on visits to the farm huts, many did not, and the proportion of potential hosts under treated nets was always much lower at the farm huts than in the villages.",
                "One might have expected greater impact on the more anthropophilic A. minimus species A and A. dirus s.l., but there was little evidence for this. The strongest evidence came from the village Mae Chon; in the long-term study, the densities and/or parous rat& of these-species we& significantly lower in 1991 than 1990. Was this because the nets did have an effect in Mae Chon, but for some reason did not do so in Mae Salap and Huai Ngu, or were the decreases in Mae Chon merely a reflection of local environmental changes? There can be no conclusive answer to this question, but evidence in favour of the latter explanation, in the case of A. minimus species A, is available from the short-term study.",
                "In the short-term study, densities of A. minimus soecies A in Mae Chon and in the Wild Animal Conservation Centre did decrease in the second half of the study, following the introduction of treated nets. However, there are 3 reasons for believing that this was not due to the treated nets. Firstly, a very similar pattern was seen at the same time in Mae Top Nua, where treated nets had been in use during the first half of the study and had just been removed. Secondly, the decrease in density was accompanied by a slight increase in parous rates, as would be expected if it were due to a decrease in recruitment, and <he opposite of what would be expected if it were due to an increase in mortalitv. Thirdlv, the decline in numbers in both Mae Chon and-the Wild-Animal Conservation Centre began 6-10 d after the introduction of treated nets. and continued for another 10-12 d. This is not the pat&n that would be expected if it were an effect of treated nets. Assuming that the parous rates observed in this study (50-70%) are a reasonable guide to rates of survival per gonotrophic cycle, few of the mosquitoes alive on a given day can be expected to remain alive one week later. Any killing effect by treated nets should therefore be manifest within a few days and be very close to its maximum within 10 d of intervention.",
                "For these reasons, we conclude that the treated nets did not have a mass killing effect on A. minimus species A. The results agree with-2 other studies in Tak-province. about 200 km south of Mae Sariana, bv C. Green (unpublished data) and M. Prasittisuk &ersonal communication) .",
                "The numbers of A. dims s.2. were too low to permit a conclusive result. However, C. Green (unpublished data) observed in a small trial in Tak province that treated nets had a significant impact on A. dirus species A, but not species D. Further investigation on this species group is needed.",
                "In conclusion, these results indicate that communitywide use of pyrethroid-treated nets does not enerally reduce the vectorial capacity of populations o i: A. mtmmus '. species A and the A. macularus group in north-west Thailand. This does not mean that treated nets are ineffective in protecting against malaria; an individual sleeping under a treated net should nevertheless gain good personal protection against vector biting. However, the lack of a mass effect does mean that there is no protection for people outside nets. From the point of view of an individual who does sleep under a treated net, it does not matter whether or not others in the same community do so as well. From the public health point of view, it means that there is no advantage (in terms of efficacy) in organizing the impregnation of nets on a community-by-community basis, rather than household-by-household, which may often be easier in practice.",

            "One possible alternative method for control of malaria is the use of pyrethroid-treated bed nets (ROZENDAAL, 1989; WHO, 1989; CURTIS et al., 1990), which have shown benefits in reducing the number of bites on humans sleeping within them, even if there are holes in them, or on humans nearby because of the deterrent and excite-repellent effects and feeding inhibition of the insecticide (LINES et al., 1987). When used by a whole community, the treated nets might be expected to have a 'mass effect', reducing the density and longevity of vector populations, and thus providing an additional benefit above the improved personal protection provided by individual use. However, of the numerous trials reviewed by CURTIS (1992) or reported more recently (SAMA-RAWICKREMA et al., 1992; BEACH et al., 1993; DAS et al., 1993; HII et al., 1993; KARCH et al., 1993; KERE et al., 1993; LINDSAY et al., 1993a, 1993b), many were not designed to allow detection of a mass effect, and in others no mass effect was seen. The clearest evidence for a mass effect has come from trials with anthropophilic and endophilic A. gambiae in Africa (MAGESA et al., 1991; RO-BERT & CARNEVALE, 1991; KARCH et al., 1993), with endophilic populations of A. minimus s.1. in India (JANA-KARA et al., in press), and with A. farauti in the Solomon Islands (KERE et al., 1993). Howevey, evidence for the absence of a mass effect with A. gambtae s.1. was reported from The Gambia; this may have been due to the mixing of mosquito populations between villages with treated and untreated bed nets (LINDSAY et al., 1993b). In the A. tn4nctulatus complex in Papua New Guinea, there was a-reduction in th; human blood index and a sluft in the peak time of biting from late to early in",

This paper presents the entomological evaluation, which consisted of a long-term and a short-term study. The impact on malaria incidence will be presented separately by A. Aramrattana et al. (paper in preparation).",
            "Four forest fringe villages, Mae Han, Mae Chon, Mae Top Nua and Mae Salap, and a deep forest village, Huai Neu. were selected for the studv. These villages were aGong the 24 units of a arasitolo&cal evaluation(AR.4~- RATTANA, 1993). Mae f!I alap and Huai Ngu are isolated villages. At Mae Top Nua there is a neighbouring village about 500 m away, separated by 2 hills. Mae Han and Mae Chon are separated from each other by about 800 m and a hill. The annual malaria Darasite incidence in 1989 varied from 80.7-279.7 per 1060 persons. Details of the population and bed net usage are given in Table 1. Detection of malaria sporozoites by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BURKOT et al., 1984; WIRTZ et al., 1987) has suggested that A. minimus species A, A. sawadwongporni (formerly A. maculatus species A), A. maculatus S.S. and A. dirus s.1. are the potential vectors in the area (SOMBOON, 1993).",
            "aData from Mae Sariang Malaria Sector (1990).",
            "Net census, impregnation and distribution. Most people in the area used cotton or cotton-polyester nets. In an attempt to obtain a high rate of net &age, a census was carried out in earlv 1990 and a number of additional nets were distributed at a subsidized price. Over 80% of nets in all the entomological study villages were treated in the first round of impregnation; except for Mae Han where the coverage was verv low (see Table 11. In the second round of Geatment in October/ November 1991, relatively low coverage was found over the whole study area. Details of net impregnation and distribution will be described by A. Aramrattana et al. (paper in preparation).",
            "Study design and study area. Since recruitment to mosquito populations fluctuates widely in the short term, more intensive measurements of mosquito density and parous rates on a daily basis may give a more reliable picture than less intensive occasional sampling over longer periods, as was done in the long-term study (CHARL-WOOD et al., 1985; CHARLWOOD & GRAVES, 1987; HOLMES & BIRLEY, 1987). Daily sampling increases the sample size in relation to variability so that small changes in the mosquito density and parous rate may be detected. A short-term study of the effect of treated bed nets on vector populations was therefore carried out in order to complement the long-term study. A cross-over design permitted each village to act as both control and treated units, thus allowing for the permanent effects of environmental differences. Washing of nets was unlikely to have taken place over the relatively short study period and was easy to check.",
            "Mosquito collection. CDC light-trap catches were used for daily collection of mosquitoes, hung beside occupied untreated bed nets (to avoid the deterrent and excitorepellent effects of the insecticide) in each of 3 houses in each community. They were connected with rechargeable batteries in the evening and disconnected in the morning by the project team. This method has shown a fairly good correlation with indoor human-biting catches in sampling A. minimus species A, which was the most abundant indoor biting species (ISMAIL et al., 1982; SOM-BOON, 1993). To reduce mortality of trapped mosquitoes caused by the wind from the trap's fan, the necks of the collection bags were extended to 35.5 cm, and the top of",
            "The 2 studies described here differed not only in their timing but also in the intensity of entomological monitoring. The long-term study, which covered 8 months of the year, yielded adequate numbers of A. sawadwongpork and A. maculatus S.S. as well as A. minimus species A, but suffered from the washing of about 40% of the nets by villagers after the first impregnation, and from the low rate of reimpregnation. These problems were probably associated with the net washing habit of villagers, sideeffects of the insecticide and the timing of reimpregnation during the period of harvest, when most people were in the rice fields all day. The short-term study was more focused and did not suffer from the problems of net washing and low coverage. Washing nets is known to reduce greatly the insecticidal activity of treated nets (MIL-LER et al., 1991).",
            "The absence of a detectable mass killing effect of treated nets on A. minimus species A contrasts with the results of JANA-KARA et al. (in press) in Assam, India. This is presumably related to the biting behaviour of mosquitoes. A. minimus species A in Thailand is exophaglc, exophilic, and readily bites humans and animals ihr&ghoutihenight (ISMAIL et al., ~~~~;RATANATHAM et al.. 1988: P. Somboon. unoublished data).

            "In addition, the existence of domestic animals in a human residential area can diminish the mosquito attack rate on humans (COLUZZI, 1984; BURKOT et al., 1989).

There were great fluctuations of both mosquito density and parous rate. Heavy rains followed by flooding occurred in the middle of the first period and at the end of July to early August. This seemed to be associated with a large reduction in the mosquito densities in most sites, which were observed 4-5 d after flooding."

            "content": "One possible alternative method for control of malaria is the use of pyrethroid-treated bed nets (ROZENDAAL, 1989; WHO, 1989; CURTIS et al., 1990), which have shown benefits in reducing the number of bites on humans sleeping within them, even if there are holes in them, or on humans nearby because of the deterrent and excite-repellent effects and feeding inhibition of the insecticide (LINES et al., 1987). When used by a whole community, the treated nets might be expected to have a 'mass effect', reducing the density and longevity of vector populations, and thus providing an additional benefit above the improved personal protection provided by individual use. However, of the numerous trials reviewed by CURTIS (1992) or reported more recently (SAMA-RAWICKREMA et al., 1992; BEACH et al., 1993; DAS et al., 1993; HII et al., 1993; KARCH et al., 1993; KERE et al., 1993; LINDSAY et al., 1993a, 1993b), many were not designed to allow detection of a mass effect, and in others no mass effect was seen. The clearest evidence for a mass effect has come from trials with anthropophilic and endophilic A. gambiae in Africa (MAGESA et al., 1991; RO-BERT & CARNEVALE, 1991; KARCH et al., 1993), with endophilic populations of A. minimus s.1. in India (JANA-KARA et al., in press), and with A. farauti in the Solomon Islands (KERE et al., 1993). Howevey, evidence for the absence of a mass effect with A. gambtae s.1. was reported from The Gambia; this may have been due to the mixing of mosquito populations between villages with treated and untreated bed nets (LINDSAY et al., 1993b). In the A. tn4nctulatus complex in Papua New Guinea, there was a-reduction in th; human blood index and a sluft in the peak time of biting from late to early in",

Detection of malaria sporozoites by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BURKOT et al., 1984; WIRTZ et al., 1987) has suggested that A. minimus species A, A. sawadwongporni (formerly A. maculatus species A), A. maculatus S.S. and A. dirus s.1. are the potential vectors in the area (SOMBOON, 1993).",

Since recruitment to mosquito populations fluctuates widely in the short term, more intensive measurements of mosquito density and parous rates on a daily basis may give a more reliable picture than less intensive occasional sampling over longer periods, as was done in the long-term study (CHARL-WOOD et al., 1985; CHARLWOOD & GRAVES, 1987; HOLMES & BIRLEY, 1987). Daily sampling increases the sample size in relation to variability so that small changes in the mosquito density and parous rate may be detected. A short-term study of the effect of treated bed nets on vector populations was therefore carried out in order to complement the long-term study. A cross-over design permitted each village to act as both control and treated units, thus allowing for the permanent effects of environmental differences. Washing of nets was unlikely to have taken place over the relatively short study period and was easy to check.",

This method has shown a fairly good correlation with indoor human-biting catches in sampling A. minimus species A, which was the most abundant indoor biting species (ISMAIL et al., 1982; SOM-BOON, 1993).

These problems were probably associated with the net washing habit of villagers, sideeffects of the insecticide and the timing of reimpregnation during the period of harvest, when most people were in the rice fields all day. The short-term study was more focused and did not suffer from the problems of net washing and low coverage. Washing nets is known to reduce greatly the insecticidal activity of treated nets (MIL-LER et al., 1991).",
